<hr><pre>Oh, thats a windows &quot;feature&quot; You know, the frequent reboot one? Looks like
HP just modified it so that they can use it to reboot the server at will.
J/K. The more programmers start thinking they know the best for the end
users and pull stuff like this the more it ticks me off. Feel's
microsoft'ish, even though its good old HP.

Actually, I have a gripe about installing printer drivers on a terminal
server period. Some drivers just refuse to install remotely, and the only
way to get it to work is to do like drew did and physically plug the printer
into the terminal server itself. Now tell me that isn't a pain in the rear.
How am I going to manage to do that for remote workers? Drive out, pick up
their printer, come back in, plug it in, and hope it doesn't reboot the
sucker? Honestly, IMHO if you have to reboot a damn computer after you INSTALL
A PRINTER DRIVER, THAT DRIVER HAS BEEN IMPROPERLY WRITTEN TO NEED TOO MANY
OTHER THINGS FROM YOUR COMPUTER. It shouldn't be complicated.

Hey drew, did it install the image zone software for you also? That has got
to be my favorite bloatware of the year. Its to the point where you can't go
online from HP and download a driver for your printer without getting the
438MB version. Even 6meg is too big in my opinion. ITS A FRICKING PRINTER
DRIVER!!!!

Ok, I feel better now.

<hr><pre>I feel your pain.  I'm a microsoft certified tech
(please no tomatoes) and I've scene similar instances
of stupid stuff like that happening.  I hate to see
developer and/or software companies develop anything
with microsoft syndrome (ie the compulsive need to
make your decisions for you without giving you any
choices and/or options).

Some of my fellow co-workers where I work (I work for
a VISP) ask me why I have anti-windows desktops and I
work on a windows XP machine. I know this is more a
dev thing than windows in general but it's gotten to
the point where it's synonamous to me.  For me it's
not that I hate the company any more than anybody else
its more about I hate the mindset used on how they
create their software that has spread to other
companies, &quot;If microsoft can get away with it so can
I.&quot; That in turn drives down the quality of
production.  

Hence my learning Unix based OS's.  The open source
testing model I think is far superior to the
traditional testing modem.

I was installing a printer on a network (not a network
printer mind you) , but oh wait for some reason the
server the printer is attached to is taking up WAY too
much processor time when anybody prints and other
services on the server become stalled (or occasionally
lock up and/or crash then don't respond anymore even
when the process is done).  Turns out the driver
manufacturer made the driver so that it runs at a
higher priority level than normal(and it was probably
made poorly anyway) that also ate up gobs of ram. I
tend to think of it now as the Godzilla print driver. 

A fix came out later in the form of better drivers
thankfully.

I feel your pain drew.  That is one of a few reasons
why I don't do many side jobs anymore.

Are you sure?  That sounds like it's operating as designed.  Didn't TFM tell
you that it would reboot as if by magic?  You did RTFM, right?

Ok.  On a more serious note (everyone gets that the last post was a funny, I
hope), you should *never* do something like this on a production system.  That
they required you to do such a thing is just bad (on the part of your customer
and your boss that told you to do it).  

I believe you would have been money ahead to simply purchase[1] a USB jet
direct[2] and make the printer network aware via that interface.  This pushes
the driver installs out to the clients hopefully and eliminates adding
complexity to your server.

The list prices on these guys is usually somewhere in the $300 or less range.
The downtime the bean counters had was most assuredly worth more that this
(and this is the angle to take with them if they resist purchasing the items).

HTH,
--Robert
============================================
[1] We stock several of these (non-USB) to get us back up and running when the
internal print servers on our printers bail (or if someone *has* to have that
certain printer that doesn't do networking).

That works great if you have a spare server and the money to pay someone the
billable hours to install/maintain the box for you.

If the customer likes this idea, than a pretty cool canned solution is the HP
4250 printer appliance.  I haven't used this, but I happen to know the
developer (Jerry Carter) and he says that this will do about 300 printers

<hr><pre>Wow, now there's an idea.  Kind of one of those ideas that makes so much
sense now that you see it in front of you, but I don't have a need for a
print server that can handle that much load.  It beats the alternative
of buying an x86 server and OS to run it.  Probably would be more
expensive anyway.  Thanks for the linkage Robert!

That works great if you have a spare server and the money to pay someone
the
billable hours to install/maintain the box for you.

If the customer likes this idea, than a pretty cool canned solution is
the HP
4250 printer appliance.  I haven't used this, but I happen to know the

<hr><pre>The Sad thing is that &quot;TFM&quot; is located in html/helper that gets installed in
the 400mb installer. LOL . I did advise against the installing of printer on
server but the owner of the firm wanted it done. We are after all paid to do
what the customer wants. We can recomend against it but in the end they pay
the bill we do what we are told to do. Yeah I love the Jet Direct servers.
I've found dlink has a very resonalble substuture. it's about $100. Not as
feature filled as the HP version, but $200 less. Stable and works as
standard LPR or IP printer.

It's not so much the reboot itself that bothers me (though I don't
disagree with you).  It's the reboot you don't get asked or even WARNED
about that I -REALLY- hate.

I installed one update which I'm glad I happened to exit all my other
apps before completing.  After the update finished installing, it
unceremoniously rebooted my machine with neither warning nor
confirmation.  At least some of the DirectX installers say &quot;Hey, I'm
gonna reboot the computer now.  [OK button]&quot;.  I'm not too fond of that,
though (no option of not rebooting), but it's better than absolutely no
warning or confirmation.

I would prefer to be told a reboot will be required before starting an
install. I want the option to decline completely and be assured that nothing
on my system has been changed.
