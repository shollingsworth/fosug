talked about the meeting in a while.

He's not a snob, he's an elitist. LOL. j/k

No offense taken. I didn't see anything wrong with anything you've said. Maybe
it's just because I see where you are coming from in trying to have people do
the &quot;right thing&quot; or do it the correct or even a better way.

I figure I've learned quit a bit in the last 24 hours.

I figured out how to actually configure mutt to work with Lists MUCH better,
and now understand why some mailing lists don't rewrite the Reply-To (or
whatever it is exactly) header. And how to correctly reply to the list.
There's just that whole training myself to use L and not r.

Umm WTHeck else did I learn. hmmm. 

Oh I did find a PHP-based album. Just need to tidy up it's security...I was
playing with it at like midnight last night so yeah there's stuff that didn't
get done. Dumped about 23 albums into it.

I think once I do that, I'm about ready to cut over to the new setup.

Router: eMachine 533 Celeron 256MB RAM. Yeah, OVERKILL. But it's what I had
that would work reliably to config it. I might reinstall the old router to
IPCop and transfer the config there and reclaim the eMachine for something.

I might take a look at Asterisk. I found a guy who is selling the old single
port Digiam FXO cards for like $7 on eBay. There's a RHEL-based Asterisk@home
distro. Think IPCop for Asterisk. We've got cordless phones, so I wouldn't
need to run wire all over the place. I'd just need a couple of FXS ports.

Someone actually has it running on an Eden board (Mini-ITX). Heck, the
original Asterisk author has it running on an X-Box.

Ack I'm rambling on again.

Patrick

Just a little advise, double check that the PHP based album (and
everything PHP based) has patches for all of the lastest PHP security
holes.

Servers left and right are being cracked because of various holes in PHP.


imho,

Steve
