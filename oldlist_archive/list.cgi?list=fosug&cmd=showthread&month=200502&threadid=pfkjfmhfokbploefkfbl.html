Good lord... these people are relentless are'nt they?

OK, so everybody reports spam. Everybody makes their mail server
secure with baysian filters. What's next? These cat's won't stop....
hell they're making money. What's not to love about that?

My friend Frank from a large company here in the central valley
says... that the only way to stop spam is by &quot;trusted user&quot; lists in
which people only accept mail from lists rather than domains or even
countries.

Honestly this is the way I see things going. These bastards,
bastardize smtp and what is really to be expected from such a plain
text weak protocol? Give me a break.

As an admin I'm tired of dealing with this BS. It's frustrating...
what else are we to do with our time but sort through an endless
barrage of this bullshit in our inboxes.... grrrrrrrrr

It's enough to turn any of us sour.

What do you guys think?

<hr><pre>The 1st thing that comes to mind for me is public castration -- web
streaming video broadcast of course.  This would be for the spammer
and the individual who funded this gross invasion of the Internet. 
Anonymity has its sunny side but the black side of the cloud is SPAM. 
Now that I've vented without solving the cause of our frustration,
I'll retreat to vent another day.

Now for a bit of news.  I was at NOAA, government weather, in Hanford
today and found that all the government forecasting is done on Linux
systems with a government brewed free GIS system.  The scope of what
this application does is almost beyond belief.  I'm in the process of
trying to install this beautiful beast on SuSE 9.2.  The tarball was
intended for Red Hat.  Anyone interested, let me know.

Yes.  But you already knew this.

&gt; OK, so everybody reports spam. Everybody makes their mail server
&gt; secure with baysian filters. What's next? These cat's won't stop....
&gt; hell they're making money. What's not to love about that?

Hehe.  If you really want to know what's next, send me a private email or call
me at home.  Be warned; you're likely to lose a night's sleep over it.

&gt; My friend Frank from a large company here in the central valley
&gt; says... that the only way to stop spam is by &quot;trusted user&quot; lists in
&gt; which people only accept mail from lists rather than domains or even
&gt; countries.

Bzzzzz!  Care to guess again?  The only way to stop spam is to make it
non-profitable.  Trusted user lists are the same solution as RBLs with a shift
in the implementation point.  Is your friend a friend of Bills?  That's the
current Redmond point of view.  Fun thing there is who gets to control the
list.

&gt; Honestly this is the way I see things going. These bastards,
&gt; bastardize smtp and what is really to be expected from such a plain
&gt; text weak protocol? Give me a break.

The protocol isn't to blame, per se.  It was invented back when people were
trusting (a la telnet).  The protocol is actually quite robust.  The fact that
it is being used for evil doesn't demonize the protocol.  I'm not certain that
there's a protocol solution for email anyway.  All of the suggestions I've
heard to date only use the protocol as the next step in the spam arms race
(while simultaneously breaking email for all who don't adopt).

&gt; As an admin I'm tired of dealing with this BS. It's frustrating...
&gt; what else are we to do with our time but sort through an endless
&gt; barrage of this bullshit in our inboxes.... grrrrrrrrr

I'm a fan of caffeine and woodworking.

Step away from the machine.

&gt; It's enough to turn any of us sour.

Maybe.  At this point, I'm fairly well amused with a majority of the spam that
I see.  Some of it is rank, but for the most part, the ludicrous nature of the
bulk of the spam is hilarious.

One of the things that would help immensely would be to rid the net of html
email, en mass.  If it has a content-type text/html header in it, it doesn't
make it to the destination.  That takes care of microspams and the bulk of the
'tricks' in use by spammers today.

&gt; What do you guys think?

I think I'm glad you've woken up to the topic.  Now we have something else to
rant about together.  You never seemed to interested in the topic before when
I was showing you mutt/bogofilter/postfix.  I think you'll be more perky now.
