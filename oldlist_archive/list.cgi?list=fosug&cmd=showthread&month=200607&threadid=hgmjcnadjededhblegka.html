<hr><pre>I'd noticed that QCad is mentioned on the FOSUG home-page.  

While going through a Debian package upgrade, in checking on what aptitude was 
proposing to do about the packge relations, I'd noticed that I'd had a couple 
of manual packages installed, for something that I wasn't familiar with; I 
guess I'd installed the main package, then uninstalled it, and forgot about 
the manual packages.

The main package: varkon

Apparently, VARKON is a CAD system. Homepage to the project: 
<a href="http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/">http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/</a>

the documentation packages:
varkon-programmer-manual
varkon-user-manual

The debian package description on VARKON:
----------
 VARKON is a high level development tool for applications in the
 area of Engineering, Computer Aided Design and Product Modelling.
 
 VARKON can be used as a traditional CAD-system with drafting,
 modelling and visualisation, if you want to, but the real power of
 VARKON is in parametric modelling and CAD applications development.
 VARKON includes interactive parametric modelling in 2D or 3D but also
 the unique MBS programming language integrated in the graphical
 environment.
 
 Homepage: <a href="http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon">http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon</a>
----------

For what it's worth, VARKON has been around since probalby before 1998. (There 
was a mention of the VARKON home-page, in a 1998 issue of the Linux Gazette)

I wasn't able to dig up a screen-shot, and it'll be a bit while before I can 
make one, on my own box -- didn't have the varkon package installed, and to 
get it installed by way of apt, I'll have some 230 megs of package-upgrades 
to download, along-with varkon, over a nice 56k conection. (It may be like 
tin-cans and twine, there, but it's feasible. IMO, using the Debian setup, 
it's more feasible than it might otherwise be.)

So, I wanted to bring VARKON to the group's attention, in case it would be of 
interest to folks using maybe-not-autocad CAD systems.

I know that QCad is really neat. I don't mean to steal fire from the QCad 
developers, either, but it looks like VARKON has had quite a lot of time and 
effort put into it -- probably would be rather feasible, in a project 
sponsored by a U, viz. Örebro University 
<a href="http://www.oru.se/templates/oruExtIntroPageLevel2____4965.aspx">http://www.oru.se/templates/oruExtIntroPageLevel2____4965.aspx</a> and which has 
been around for a time.

So, there's the mention of VARKON

Speaking tangentially: Has anyone's thought of taking the body of construction 
contractors like as a focus 'market' about software and systems? 

For one thing: There could be some facilitation done, in tramisttal, recall, 
and review on electronic blueprints. Maybe something could be done, with it, 
to get some focused-in areas of blueprints, shared from the primary 
contractor, out to the sub-contractors, like on PDAs and/or laptops and/or 
plain paper, in illustration of what each individual contractor would have as 
a focus, for a duration, such that each contractor and each contractor's team 
would each be working on  (e.g. for a wall that needs to a cabinet put onto 
it, the blueprints on that section of the wall could be distributed to the 
cabinetry contractor. To the electrical contractor, I'm not sure of what all 
would need to be shared, but it's looked like they'd need to kno all the 
spots and drafted contents for conduits, and there'd be spots where wires 
meet, like in a spot in a  drop ceiling or in a switch-unit accesible on or 
via a wall).  

Then, the blueprints would need to be kept, by whom was contracting the 
general contractor. They'd have to be kept somewhere central, where they 
could be recalled, and where any details on the blueprints could be located.

I'm not all sure of how many contractors would go for this -- all dug in with 
software &amp; systems &amp; such, it could seem -- but it seems feasible. When 
explained and proved workable, I'm sure it could be feasible to a contractor. 

With some support in the making of an online community for contractors, it 
might be more feasible. An online directory of contractors, as part to such a 
community, might also be feasible.

In the design of a mechanism for the blueprint stuff, there might be enough 
grounds in it for to base a general system for blueprint sharing, applicable 
beyond the context of &quot;blueprint sharing between engineer, 
general-contractor, and contracting body.&quot; 

A neat feature would be to work-in a means for blueprint annotation, also, 
somewhere in or beside the thing. That, then, would need some sort of a GUI 
client, and would be specific to a given CAD format.

Given the software for it, one could  also work-in support for automation in 
electronic-blueprint reformatting. That, then, could serve to assist in that 
a CAD systems besides Autocad would be put to use, at a site. It might also 
serve to assist in the production of professionally raytraced scenes, based 
on blueprint information.

Putting a strong emphasis about security, in the system would be required -- 
there'd be yay-much info sharing, in it. Making such an emphasis, in 
discourse about the system, maybe that could be worth it, also.  )I'd pesume 
that most contractors would be in a spot where they'd any have to answer to 
any more of managers, and where they'd be making the decision about &quot;what 
gets put into implementation&quot;, in their work. I've not worked in an 
executive-managerial position, but I've been around enough to come to presume 
that there's yay-much bureaucracy involved about proposing a system for 
implementation, in an agency scenario.)

This is sketch-work. I figured it could be worth it.

I can't make any of this happen of only my own person. I've noticed that it's 
feasible. Given the number of contractors in the Fresno area, and further, 
maybe it could be worth the effort, fiscally. Given that it would be done in 
the making of a meeting about software to contractors, I'd think it would be 
worth the effort, pragmatically. 

Given the propensity for that it could be used internationally, and when it 
would be a service/system product developed in a FOSS systems environment, 
maybe it could be worth it, to make it as a thing based wholly with FOSS 
components. In one part of that, there could be more of a likelihood for 
finding persons willing and able to translate text displayed in components to 
the system.

It might sound like one helluva stretch, then, but I'd propose that it would 
be considered for implementation -- directly in the software components to it 
-- in Common Lisp. Certainly, there'd be cause to use existing software 
components not programmed in Common Lisp. I know Common Lisp, and I like it 
as a langauge; it's what I'd propose for systematic &quot;glue&quot;, and for the 
implementation of new system-service components.

As it were, this started to come to mind while I as in a spot as a 
day-laborer, on the site of the Gottschalks Riverpark center. (It was an easy 
job to get, then, just showed up to Labor Ready office, then happend to be 
dispatched to that site. &quot;Moving stuff and cleaning-up stuff&quot; was the full 
bill of it. The trudging around, in the cleanup of the contractor's discards, 
that wasn't all fun -- and I'll tell y', the manufactureers put something, 
it's  probably milk-related, judging by the aroma of it, as an ingredient in 
some grout material; it occasions a real funky smell, after it sits around, 
for a time. Overall, though, it wasn't a bad experience. It was a job. It was 
a job in contingence about construction. It was a job I could get, without 
having a collegiate degree, a resume worth showing, or a body of vocational 
skills that I can expect to get hired at. and my grandpa was in construction, 
I'd bet he'd be surprised I was there.)

Not to burden the list with this sketch-work, but to share the notes, I guess, 
and to see  what folks might think of any of this being made as a FOSS 
project, and as a matter of focus in a business/commercial endeavor. (I know, 
I could start a project at SourceForge for what of the software of this; if 
I'm the only one on it, it will go no-where, as I cannot go far with it, of 
my own person; I'd wind up heading onto something else, and that could be the 
end of it.)

<hr><pre>It was a bit hard to follow what you were proposing, but I believe you were
proposing a digital blueprint room? Is this correct?

I know that there are 2 electrical and one general contractor &quot;represented&quot;
here. Not on an official capacity, but that employees of those firms are
members of the groups. I can't speak for the general or one of the electrical
contractors, I work for the 2nd electrical contractor, and of course can't
speak officially for my employer.

Is your plan for an archival system with As-Builts? I personally despise
as-builts in general (they are a complete PITA to draw, I should know, that's
part of what I do as a draftsman) and plan archiving is even more of a PITA.
Paper drawings take up HUGE amounts of physical space and are a nightmare to
manage. Currently we store plans in our warehouse (not exactly paper storage
friendly) in a small area, maybe 100 ft^2. Rubber bands last less than 1 year
for the most part out there.

Most digital archiving is done like this. The as-built drawings are supplied
up-stream. Depending on who we are working for, we send the &quot;customer&quot; the
as-builts. This could be to the general contractor or to the owner directly.
Previously everything was done in analoge. We sent paper drawings and
Operation and Maintenance Manuals (i.e. the &quot;Owners manual&quot;). Now we include a
CD with PDFs of the drawings, and possibly of the O&amp;M if we have them. Most of
the lighting submittals are done via PDF now anyways, and manuals for most
equipment as well.

Some developers have even completely stopped keeping paper drawings or
whatever. I know that larging shopping area that's very popular has all of the
paper as-builts drawings scanned into TIFF files and these are kept on DVD.
There's an application that actually catalogues these so you can easily call
them up. The scanning is done via a large format Oce scanner at the
reprographics bureu. The TIFFs can then be sent to the bureu to have copies
made.

At several dollars per scan, it's not something that's in the reach of many
contractors, or they just don't want to put out the money. We looked at an Oce
setup and entry level, was well over $25K. This particular bureu has (2) Oce
9800s that run $65-$100K.

One of the big issues with sending files around, ESPECIALLY CAD files, is data
security. The company that I work for was &quot;ripped off&quot; if you will. We had
sent AutoCAD files to the architect for a job. He then forwarded these files
to an electrical engineer who was doing the design work for the same customer
in another town. This was a building that was essentially a mirror image.

Our plans went through plan check without any corrections coming back. The
architect sent us the backcheck items from this other job as an FYI. (FYI to
him, you're a moron). We got this list and were a bit puzzled why he would do
this. Looking over the list we checked them against our plans. We noticed that
we had some of the exact same errors. Hmmmm.

We were able to obtain a set of the plans from the developer (same developer
on both jobs) and found that errors were near the same, on the same page. To
say this was a copyright violation would be mild. The results were the
arhitect's ties to the developer were severed and the electrical engineer,
without admitting fault/guilt, departed with some funds.

As a result, AutoCAD files are very rarely, and not without good reason, sent
out. Mostly files are transmitted in PDF. Usually if they are, its for working
drawings of proposals. I.e. layouts of electrical rooms, etc. Nothing that you
could do much with. Full sets are only transmitted as PDFs.
