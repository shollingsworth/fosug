<hr><pre>Sorry for the late notice.  I'll try to be better about this in the future
(depending on how this one goes, I may have another).

I'm currently planning on a tour of the facilities this weekend.  The tour
needs to take place either early in the morning or later in the evening.

The available start times are 8:00 AM or 5:00 PM and both would be meeting at
the Water Division headquarters (1910 E. University - if you can't use online
mapping, don't show up ;-) ).  My preference is for the early start.  I only
have room for 6 people, so first come, first served.

As previously discussed, I'll give the tour of how we're using FOSS in our
environment, some projects that are in the works and there will also be a tour
of the surface water treatment facility (SWTF).  If we start early, we'll
likely start with the SWTF and finish at headquarters with the FOSS tour.

Looking forward to it.

I'd say 5pm would be better. Weekend mornings are always groggy for me :-P

Cheers,

Ok.  The vampires have it!  

Start time: 1700.
Location:  1910 E. University

Agenda in brief:
  1700  - Tour of division headquarters.
          Brief overview of what it is we do at the water division.
          Discussion of FOSS in use at the division.
  1830  - Depart water yard for SWTF (I'll be driving.  Prayers should be
          uttered tonight!)
  1900  - Tour SWTF.
  2000  - Depart for water yard and finish up.

To date, I have slots for Stevo, Mike and Stephan.  3 slots left.  For those
who will be going, please send me an off-list email with your phone number so
that I may call and mock you if you fail to remember.

If you're truly paranoid, you may pgp encrypt your message using my public key
located at <a href="http://www.fosug.org/RobertNickel.asc">http://www.fosug.org/RobertNickel.asc</a> .  This will ensure that
nobody gets your phone number until I write it on a bathroom stall. ;-)
