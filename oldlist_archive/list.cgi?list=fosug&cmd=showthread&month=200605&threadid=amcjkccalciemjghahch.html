So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the
Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come
speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They it was who dislodged
the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, or
driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not
long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on
either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle
below.
But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. In that last
hour Beorn himself had appeared €&quot; no one knew how or from where. He came
alone, and in bears shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to
giant-size in his wrath. The roar of his voice was like drums and guns;
and he tossed wolves and goblins from his path like straws and feathers.

<hr><pre>Nice little copyright violation. Don't think that qualifies as &quot;fair
use&quot; :-)  
Not that these rats care.

Maybe they think you'll forgive them for spamming you because of their
good taste in literature?  And too bad Beorn didn't take part in the War
of the Ring.
