<hr><pre>Dear All,

&gt;&gt;Wonder why the Desktop version wouldn't work. Hmm. . .What kind of 
&gt;&gt;hardware?&lt;&lt;

    I *knew* I'd be going to Hardware Purgatory!! &lt;g&gt;

ASUS P2-99 mainboard
Celeron 466 chip
196mg RAM
ATI Rage Fury Pro/Xpert 2000 Pro Video
Sound Blaster 16 bit
LiteOn 52x/32x/52x CD RW (brand new)
Smart Link 56K modem
D-Link DFE-530Tx+PCI nic
Iomega Zip 100 drive
Standard Issue Floppy
No USB

&gt;&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf&lt;&lt;

    I typed it in exactly as above (without brackets), and got:

No such file or directory

&gt;&gt;If not, I'd try and install it again, this time letting it run the default 
&gt;&gt;install, not sure if you picked any packages.&lt;&lt;

    I ran what I thought to be the default install, however, it's possible I 
unknowingly made a wrong choice at some point.

&gt;&gt;Ronnie, could you give more details on what happened w/ the desktop 
&gt;&gt;install?&lt;&lt;

    The most noticeable thing was that it was very painfully slow to load 
the desktop after it booted.
    When I decided to install it to drive, it took many, many minutes for 
the install screen to start and render. The first screen wants a languge 
choice, and once it finally rendered, and I clicked the &quot;next&quot; button, the 
&quot;wait&quot; symbol twirled forever, and finally, it ground to a halt and froze 
before reaching the second question.
    Before I decided to install, I had clicked on one or two choices (just 
looking) beforehand that never materialized. It may be that it was 
overloaded by the time I decided to install.
    For the heck of it, I'm trying Chad's idea of loading Kubuntu - after 
all, it appears to be pretty tweaked at this point, I doubt I could mess it 
up any more. . .and reformatting covers a multitude of sins.
    At any point when y'all get stuck, or frustrated beyond all bounds, let 
me know and I'll 1) try to reload the desktop and/or 2) wait until I can get 
hands-on help.

<hr><pre>An oldie but goodie.  You may not have enough machine for full blown Linux.
A more minimal GUI for instance may be called for.  IMHO I'd try Puppy Linux
or Damn Small Linux on that box.  They both have GUI's more in keeping with
your horsepower.  Older high end graphics cards can also cause issues unless
treated as generic VESA.  The rest of the group has considerably more Linux
experience than I and may have other suggestions.

Have a great day -- George

    OK. That probably explains why the Live CD didn't really work well.  The live CD was too slow to even properly evaluate anything.
    As I mentioned to Chad, I'll probably to want to redo the whole thing later, according to your suggestions. I've seen Linux set up before, but this is my first time at my own workbench with my own stuff to experiment with. 
    I very much appreciate everyone's input.

<hr><pre>Ronnie,

Even on a faster machine running from a CD is noticably slower than hard
disk.  Xbuntu may serve you well.

Have a great day -- George

    Yeah, I can understand that, but there's slow, and then there's dead 
slow. We killed the calf with this one. I'm gonna try the live cd on my new 
computer and see how that works.
    The Kubuntu is working fairly well. It's just a bit slower than running 
W2K on it, which is acceptable for at least testing purposes. So far, so 
good.
