<hr><pre>Greetings tech gurus,

I'm nothing but a lurker on this list (as I am practically a luddite  
compared to you all), but I experienced something funky with the  
City's new Wifi network and I was hoping y'all could shed a little  
light on it.

If you haven't heard, the City is offering free wifi on the Fulton  
Mall between Fresno and Tulare Streets and also on Kern Street (you  
can see the transmitter thingies on lightposts and on the Mall's  
clock tower). So last night I went down there to try it out.

I joined the &quot;cityoffresnofreewifiproject&quot; network and got on. It  
took me to a start page with the city's logo on it, and I clicked a  
button that said &quot;connect&quot;.  Tried to get to my blog to post, but  a  
series of two pop up windows opened saying that the certificates were  
not verified and did I want to proceed anyway (seemed like they were  
messages from Lok Technology, which I think is running security for  
the WiFi network?)  I honestly paid no attention to these messages  
and am not really sure what they said. I just clicked &quot;ok&quot; to get on  
my merry way. Then I connected to fresnofamous.com, but when I tried  
to post a new blog entry, I got this message:

Anomalous Behavior Detected -- Request Blocked

Your computer was automatically blacklisted (blocked) by the network  
due to an abnormal amount of activity originating from your  
connection. It is possible that your computer is infected with a worm  
and/or virus. Please contact your network administrator for  
assistance or more information.

I'm running a powerbook G4 with OS X 10.4.4 and Firefox 1.5.0.4.  
Pretty confidant I don't have a virus. On the WiFi start page these  
companies were listed: Mystic Technologies Inc, Unwired Broadband,  
Lok Technology, and Proxim Wireless Networks.

When I got home to my DSL line, I cleared my cache and was good to go  
again. Can anyone tell me what this means? Is the City's free WiFi  
out to get me?!

Thanks for listening!!

I haven't connected to the City Free Wifi Network but chances are that
they are running some sort of NAT setup. I take that back I'm POSITIVE
they'd be running a nat setup. Basically what happens is you get a dhcp
lease (ip address) when you logon to the network. It would be something
like the following which are called &quot;private&quot; networks.

10.20.12.1 or 192.168.55.0 or 172.16.29.55

From here they go through a router and come out the other end looking
like they came from a public ip address like 72.14.207.99 (which is an
ip for google.com)

So considering that the network probably has 100's of users connected at
the same time coming from one public ip (see above) and enough people
are going to fresnofamous.com (which very well could be ;-) your
security measures on the website thought the city wifi public IP was
being baaaaaaaaad. 


&gt; I'm running a powerbook G4 with OS X 10.4.4 and Firefox 1.5.0.4.  
&gt; Pretty confidant I don't have a virus. On the WiFi start page these  
&gt; companies were listed: Mystic Technologies Inc, Unwired Broadband,  
&gt; Lok Technology, and Proxim Wireless Networks.

I doubt you have a virus too. It's most likely the situation I described
above.

&gt; When I got home to my DSL line, I cleared my cache and was good to go  
&gt; again. Can anyone tell me what this means? Is the City's free WiFi  
&gt; out to get me?!

No, but I would be careful what sites and certificates you &quot;accept&quot;
while on the network. Sometimes hackers will act as &quot;rogue&quot; routers and
intercept traffic for the express purpose of stealing passwords, login
information, etc etc. Make sure all your traffic where you send out
usernames and passwords are encrypted. Plain text is plain death on a
public wifi like that. All you'd need is a sniffer and a little know
how.

Not that I've done anything like this :-P

If you're going to connect to a public wifi network like that I'd use a
VPN and some firewall rules that redirect traffic through your encrypted
tunnel. It'll be a little slower, but you can be more confident that the
traffic isn't going to get picked up by somebody in transit.

When you login to the network again, can you post what private IP
address and netmask it gives you?

You can do this by logging into a shell then typing ifconfig

Also visit the site <a href="http://whatismyip.com">http://whatismyip.com</a> to see what your public
(internet) ip address is.

As far as FresnoFamous.com is concerned, find out the public IP address
is and whitelist it maybe so that that error doesn't occur. But
honestly, I'm not sure I'd disable the feature for the IP because I can
guarantee there are crackers hooked in the network and doing nasty
little cracker things.

Hope this helps :-)
