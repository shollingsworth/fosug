from my postfix report, this isn't even including the before of my
amavis scan. Has anybody else notice a huge increase in spam and
viruses the past few days?

The above rejects isn't normal for my relay. And this is with my
outside firewall blocking every country besides the US and Canada.

My firewall only reported 120 bounces from other countries.

If you use Outlook on an unpatched windows machine raise your hand!

Yikes... that's a lot.

I'm starting to feel sorry for my mail relay. I think it's time I
upgraded the hardware LOL.

Yeah our spam relay is got a nice orange glow right now from over heating.
Our relay handles our mail and the domains for many other clients as well.
Poor Poor relay.  Thank god for clusters.

My home account (this one) used to never get any spam. Now it varies.
Sometimes none, other times, it will get hammered. I was getting some stuff
that was foreign, and based on postings on redhat-list it was a singles
company type of thing that was harvesting off the list based on some expansion
stuff they had on gmail or other.

I think it's time to set up some filtering. :(

In my case, poor Sakura-chan, my main Internet server at the house, gets
slammed with dictionary attacks all the time.  I hard-error out after
three attempts, but they keep coming.

However, since it's also the main inlet point for my IRC network's mail
service, there's not a lot I can do other than grit my &quot;teeth&quot; and
hunker down.  About the only thing I can do to cure it is to change the
e-mail domain (since the domain itself is getting hammered) as well as
change IP addresses so I don't get anymore of this (since I work at the
direct upstream provider, neither are a problem, though I also do my own
DNS hosting as well).

Unless, of course, someone else has any suggestions they might throw at
me.  Apart from the two solutions above (1.  Grin and bear it; 2.
overhaul the mail system), I can't think of any other ideas.

<hr><pre>Echoing George's sentiments about not being a sysadmin, and since I
don't run a mail relay on my home network, I don't have a lot to add
to that part of the discussion.

On the other hand, I've found a great way to cut down on the spam my
personal account receives.  Since I own my own domain with unlimited
email forwarding, I just use a different (though logical to me) email
address with each entity I interact with online.  If any of those
email addresses get out in the wild, I can filter that email to
/dev/null, or anywhere else.  I can also decide at that point whether
I want to continue interacting with some entity that would be so
careless as to share my email address with spamers.

Only my close friends/family get my private email address.  It has
worked really well for several years.
