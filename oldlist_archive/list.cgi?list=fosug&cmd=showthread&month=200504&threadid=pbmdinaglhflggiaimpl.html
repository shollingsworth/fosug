<hr><pre>For you fans of DJBs software, here is proof positive that he's evil and must
be stopped!

These are some headers of a virus email that I received last week:

I must admit that I was shocked to find DJB turning his coding skills over to
virus writing, but the evidence is overwhelming.

&gt; I must admit that I was shocked to find DJB turning his coding skills over to
&gt; virus writing, but the evidence is overwhelming.

The sad part about this, is assuming the virus has acted out the same
way as the latest generations of viruses(1),  it means that someone
who actually knows djb (either though email or visiting his website),
whom I would consider more educated and knowledgeable about &quot;computer
stuff&quot; then the average user just because they know djb, somehow got a
virus.

Of course a couple of years ago a started &quot;getting&quot; a whole spat of
them from rms, esr, and a couple of other people.

1) It grabs username and domain names form the persons web cache,
address book, and stored emails. Then uses a combination of both to
substitute in the &quot;From:&quot; and &quot;Return-Path:&quot;, to try and hide it's
true origin.

Oh, so it was actually something pretty stupid that didn't mean anything? I
get it. Anyone could have put him in their book or gone to the site. Could
have been a family member.

Guess I just didn't read as much into it. hmpf Guess I'm too bored today.
