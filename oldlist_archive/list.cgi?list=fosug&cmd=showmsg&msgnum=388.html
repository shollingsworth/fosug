<hr><pre>have you checked the cable? Many DMA transmition failures can be
results of a faulty cable. Or attaching the device to a master or
slave that is not 100% ATAPI complient.  Example. Knock off NEC ZIP
drive attached to Liteon DVD drive. Zip on master, DVD on slave. DVD
acts up. However problem is actually with zIp drive not DVD.  The way
IDE Master/slave works is.  The slave puts on leather and is required
to ask it's &quot;master&quot; permision to do anything, always terminating it's
request with a hearty &quot;SIR&quot;
ummm
errrr
heheh ok seriously tho.
If this is not your setup, still good info to keep in mind. IDE sends
all signals to the &quot;Master&quot; drive.  If the signals are intended to the
&quot;slave&quot; device. If the &quot;master&quot; device is in an idle state, it will
relay the information to the &quot;slave&quot;  Here are some limitations you
should keep in mind when dealing with IDE.  You will find that they do
work in other configurations but the only reson they work, is because
bios's attempt to fix comming wiring problems. They usually will work,
but at a reduced performacnce or reliability.

Master/Slave/Cable Select jumpers.
Never user the Cable Select jumper.  With linux this is not a huge
problem because the operating system will always access the drive
using /dev/hda, hdb, hdc, hdd etc. But because windows is a bit
sloppier in it's drive handling. A hardrive that was originaly
configured with Cable Select and has windows installed. IF for some
reason that drive becomes master, Kiss your registry good by. You will
find your C: drive suddenly something like E: and none of your
programs will work. Even setting configuration back to the original
will not fix the damage caused to the registry. Simply way to
guarantee you won't run in to this problem, is to simply never use the
cable select setting.

Drive possision on cable, and type of cable.

You will notice there are two types of cables. that looks exactaly
like a floppy cable. 40 wires running down cable.  This cable is
capable of ATA33 transmition.  This should only be used on CDROM'S
Currently there are no ATA66 or higher cdrom's or burners, but I have
seen tape drives that utilize the faster speeds.

The second cable type is ATA66/100/133. This is the exact cable for
all three speed  protocols.  Despite what compusa and monster cable
tell you, you DO NOT need to upgrade your ATA66 cables to a $25 ATA133
cables when you buy a new harddrive.
This cable allows for much faster sustained transfers.  Currently
cdroms do not use ATA66 or higher speeds. However you may use this
cable on cdroms, you just won't gain any speed benifit.  These cables
also fold and route easier around tight cases. The only con of this
cable is it's cost.  ATA66+ cables will run you a few bucks more then
the older style cables. Again despite what Compusa and monster cable
tell you, you should still not pay more then $5 for cable.  Unless
it's some super glowin dark rounded cable.
here is your cable

Drive connection. 

MB========SL===MA

You will notice you cable has two connection close to each other. and
the third cable is farther appart then the first two.

Motherboard is ALWAYS the farthest from either connector.
Slave is ALWAY middle
Master is always at the end farthest away from the motherboard. 

Alot of bios can virtualy change the pinout to allow for improper
master/slave placement, but at a cost of performance.

So if you do it right to start with you will have a higher performing system.

What drives to connect together on the same chain (cable)

keep in mind that each channel is only capable of communicating at one
protocal at time. PIO is a slow older modes that most cdroms use. UDMA
is a faster mode that harddives use to transfer data. So if you have a
brand new harddive working at ATA133 and a cdrom running at ATA33, by
placing them on the same physical cable you force your harddrive to
run at ATA33 loosing a large amount of performance. Some bios attempt
to get around this by forcing the higer speed.  The cdrom will make
alot of errors and require transmision re-requests.  The thinking
behind this is even with fixing the errors it will still be faster
then making the harddrive run at ata33. I havn't done any tests to see
if this works or not, it's just a good idea not to put your system in
the situation of having to do error correction.

Match hardrives with harddrives. Preferably the same speed. ATA133
with only 133's.

You will notice alot of cd-burners request that you place the burner
on the same chain as your harddrive to improve disk to disk copies. DO
NOT DO THIS.  The reason they recomend this is because devices on the
same chain loose a Massive amount of performance when accesss
simultaniously.  So doing disk to disk coppies on same chain, may in
some (especialy older computers) cases lead to bad burns.  By placing
the burner on the same chain as your harddrive guarantees a higher
performance on drive to drive coppies, at the cost of lowered
harddrive performance on a whole. I personaly would take a loss of
performance when I'm doing disk to disk copies, and maybe have to
reduce burning speed to compensate, vs killing the performance of my
harddrive the entire time I use the computer.

Not sure if this helped you, But these are some pet peaves I see all
the time when working on computers other people built.  Alot of people
think as long as it works then it's done &quot;correctly&quot;  Just because it
works, does not mean it's right.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; linux:/home/fragos # hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc
&gt; 
&gt; George,
&gt; 
&gt; Can you post the results of:
&gt; 
&gt; hdparm -i /dev/hdc
&gt; 
&gt; it should list a few different modes under DMA or UDMA.
