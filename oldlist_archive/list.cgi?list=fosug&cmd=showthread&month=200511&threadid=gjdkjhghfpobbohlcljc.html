Frankly, it can't be repeated enough.  This kind of crap is unacceptable.

Furthermore, I've heard tell that Symantec is pandering to these 
rootkits, ignoring them as viruses.

<hr><pre>Yeah, the company involved with writing the rootkit software here, First 4
Internet, has stated that they worked with Symantec during the development
of the product so that there were no &quot;misunderstandings&quot; re: the
virus/malware status of their product. I really wonder what the difference
is between this kind of software and say, your average spyware product? I
mean, not on a technical level, but in the user's eyes. Seems both are
extremely hard to get rid of, the both screw your computer up, and both are
there uninvited. Yup, seems like malware to me.

I don't know which freaks me out/pisses me off more: The fact that Sony was
dumb enough to think their music was worth this much pain to their customers
and that they thought they had the rights to do this, or that they are so
unapologetic about doing it when being caught and deciding not to fix the
problem.

In the past I had favored all manner of Sony products. Now that they have
taken their place at the side of the evil empire -- Microsoft. Sony is now
off my personal approved vendor list. Having sworn off Bill Gates and
company, Symantec didn't have a place on my PC either.

Sony sued over rootkits

*SONY IS FINALLY GOING* to HAVE to answer the tough questions, it is being
sued. According to the press release
<a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/here%3Chttp://www.alcei.org/index.php/archives/106%3E,">here&lt;http://www.alcei.org/index.php/archives/106&gt;,</a>

Italian group ALCEI is suing Sony over the rootkitting DRM
<a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/infection%3Chttp://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27349%3E.">infection&lt;http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27349&gt;.</a>
Since I don't speak Italian(1), I will have to take the word of readers that
they are doing things right.

It seems that ALCEI hired a noted Italian security researched names Stefano
Zanero to dot all the I's and cross all the T's. This one will be great fun
to watch, and hopefully will set the right precedents. µ

1. Armenian is just fine.

And things just got worse for Sony.  The first virus/Trojan whichj 
coopts the Sony rootkit:

Now, I'd love to see Sony BMG and First 4 Internet officials look me in 
the eyes with a straight face and try to tell me that their software 
does not compromise security.  I'd send them to the hospital requiring 
medical attention to fix facial injuries.

Well I'm sure some lawyers are going to get rich off the class action suit.
With the customers getting free, or discounted Sony Music CDs...with more copy
protection to screw up their systems.

<hr><pre>You know, this is probably the best thing that could have happened. I mean,
if left to themselves your average sheeple (lets call him/her average joe
consumer) doesn't know what a rootkit is and might not even care, thus
letting sony get away with this. Thankfully though the first time this came
up here, sony has screwed up be choosing a poorly implemented DRM scheme, a
sharp windows security toolwriter picked up on things, and now we have a ton
of lawsuits on our hands. Maybe, just maybe, we can get some laws on the
books and establish some precedent that will affect DRM installations in the
future.

That bit about the law firm getting nailed is just icing on the cake.
