<hr><pre>Quoting Al Constable ####@####.####

&gt; I'm a newbie to Linux and am interested in Fedora 3.  Any chance that there
&gt; is someone in the Fresno Users Group that would meet me for coffee or lunch
&gt; and get me up to speed on what's going on.  I haven't installed Fedora yet.
&gt;

Hi Al,

I no longer live in Fresno, in fact I'm on the opposite part of the country now.

You may want to go to <a href="http://www.fosug.org">http://www.fosug.org</a> and post to the message boards there
or you can goto irc.fosug.org to ask on IRC, there's usually one or two people
online in the chat room at any given time.  Also, there is a FOSUG mailing
list, which you can subscribe to at ####@####.####

Also, on the third Saturday of each month, there is a FOSUG meeting.  If you go
to the FOSUG web site, you'll find the meeting address and links for directions
on the right side of the page.  If your new to Linux, you will want to check out
the beginning Linux classes that Drew is giving, you'll learn a lot of valuable
information there.  After the beginning class, there is an advanced topic which
covers a lot more fun stuff, so you may want to hang around.

Best regards,

Keith Conley

You want to present on how to make a IDS bridge? LOL

I haven't heard anything from Drew, so I'm assuming that he is going
to continue his beginning linux series.

I was planning on giving a presentation on Linux Disaster Recovery and
different types of backup solutions without a tape drive.

I hope that works for everyone, because I didn't receive any
suggestions from the other FOSUG officers.

Cheers,

Stevo

Maybe someday...

Yeah, your idea sounds good to me. I've actually seen quite a few
companies that figure since they don't have a tape drive, they are
incapable of backing up thier data. Good topic.

The meeting went well. We even had pizza, beer, and rain! LOL

We missed everybody who couldn't attend. Next meeting should be more organized.

Stephan is going to present the beginning session on package
management. And Robert Nickel is going to present on Rrdtool. I'll
post on site shortly.

And the pizza was oh so yummie...NOT

And I finally figured out WTF is up with my mail server...don't you love it when you choose postfix and STILL get sendmail installed? No wonder my mail wasn't bouncing off Pacbell's server. Postfix coming in, and Sendmail going out. Something went hokey after the last power outage. Going to put the new server on the UPS. LOL. If it can hold it. I know it won't hold my Athlon &amp; 19&quot; CRT. Maybe it can hold a P3-600. If the battery is any good...which I don't think it is.

Of course I'm close to going live with the new server and IPCop for the router.

You know I experienced a problem recently with a null byte character
error message when I relayed off of smtp.comcast.net

Very strange. most people said the solution was enabling tls... which
I'm going to try. But small test messages worked great :-)

Ok, well this is what my problem was:

Power outtage about 78 days ago (that's what the router's uptime is so I'm going off of that...and it makes sense.)

When the machine came back up, the router (everything is on one machine...bad, I know...that's why I'm splitting off the router/firewall into a dedicated IPCop 1.4.4 box.) Sendmail wasn't set up right, well, wasn't ever set up at all. It was taking the outgoing mail and couldn't send it anywhere as 25 was blocked.

PacBellSBCYahoo blocks outgoing port 25 except to their servers. Didn't know this until I was rummaging around their site. I guess it's been supposedly in affect since September...never noticed a problem before. The list using smtp.pacbell.yahoo.com for my outgoing mail server. So I try that. Not authorized...ok...so I set up te SASL in postfix...not authorized. Oh holy hell...WTF. So after spending 45 minutes on the phone with Tech Support...I'm thinking New Delhi, India. They walk me through getting stuff squared (web email access and from a generic email client standpoint). The account is old, ca 2000, and isn't on the sbcglobal/yahoo system. So web based mail is over on prodigy.net and their information on their site is of absolutely no use. Outgoing mail is mail.pacbell.net (I tried smtp.pacbell.net which USED to be a server...POP3 was always postoffice.pacbell.net). The goofy thing was incoming was working perfectly. So I get all the squared away (I was setting up the new system.) Once I had relayhost = [mail.pacbell.net] all was golden. And removed Sendmail from the system.

So today I decided to fix the router, just to see if I could find the problem. I notice in the log an entry on the outgoing mail with sendmail. I thought I removed it, I didn't. So I rpm -e'ed sendmail and all is good in my world again.

So guys if you're running FC3 and using Postfix...make sure you remove Sendmail. It's always installed, no matter what. Even if you uncheck it, it still gets installed. Ack.

Next, I'd like to do the following for S&amp;Gs:

eDMS (Document Management). Scan to PDF my bills and archive them. If I do this I'd like to run a seperate instance of Apache to serve it up on a different port not reachable from outside.

Virus/spam filtering on Postfix.

Attempt in some way to secure the wireless. I'm dealing with an XP Home and a 98SE machine over wireless. Maybe I'll just block them off from my side (server, workstation &amp; Replay.) I'd like to log the connections over the WiFi just to see if anyone is piggybacking on.

HaylaFAX

Digital Answering machine...I never get calls but I never check the other machine and nobody tells anyone what their messages were. My mom has this annoying thing where she won't erase massages off of the answering machine...so it just fills up. Now she can keep them on her computer! Plus I just want to do it. Again, it's for S&amp;Gs.

I'd like a new photo album system. The one I'm using now I would run locally, then copy everything over. Well, I did it that way because the workstation is a 850 and the server was an AMD K5 PR133. Gotta love old hardware. Thing is still running from 4/97. Only changes: New Case and CPU fan (new CPU fan wouldn't fit in old case). Added a 3.1 GB drive back in ummm '98 sometime. It does have a problem with a drifting system (not hardware) clock. Oh the CD-Rom, well, I changed it out for some reason. Oh, put in like a 50x. Put that in a box. The 50x died at some point. Well, the 8x I pulled it out of a box this weekend...if had a big dent in the bottom. :O Yeah. TRASH. Wow I so forked off. Anyways. So what does everyone use, if they do? I'll have a full LAMP system so that's not an issue.

I'd like to so something with MrHouse and X10. I've got a bunch of stuff. I just need another RJ-10 (the really small RJ used in telephone handsets). My interface cable got cut. :( Not sure how much I can do, I've put in a lot of CF lamps and they don't work with the standard X10 stuff. Works ok with the appliance modules as they have a relay. But the other ones don't work...unless you like seizure inducing flickering.

ok, I think I went on long enough. LOL

You're using mutt.

RTFM! ;-)

The default binding is L to reply to a list.  

You need to add a line to your .muttrc like:

  subscribe ####@####.####

to get mutt to know that you're a user on that list.

I'm rather reluctant to munge the headers just for convenience sake.

Lists that do are broken.

I see the error of my ways now. I see how it would be a much better to do it the way that Mutt does it. That way you can reply directly to the sender. I set up a bunch of &quot;subscriptions&quot; for other lists and it seems to work. 
&gt; 
&gt; You're using mutt.
&gt; 
&gt; RTFM! ;-)
&gt; 
You know, sometimes you feel like an a** when it's obvious to some people that you don't really know how to use the software that you are using? Now if they only had a nice PDF or PS file of the manual so it would look pretty coming out of the printer at work. LOL. Looks like it's about 79 pages based on .5&quot; margins. :O I guess I have some reading material...

Kinda reminds me of this guy we had to send a drawing to. He's using AutoCAD R14 (though, it's about my fav. for versions...lot's of features without a lot of BS included) and the current version is hmm...let's see... 15 was 2000. 16 was 2002. I'm gonna guess that 17 is 2004 which is what we use. AutoCAD 2000, 2002 and the vertical products through 2003 shared a file format. 2004 products brought out a new file format. To send to him we either have to make a 2000 file format, take it into a 2000 based product and export to an R14 file OR go straight out of the current to an R12 DXF file. Dude had no clue what a DXF was! DXF is kinda like hmmm RTF. Thought it's actually an ASCII text file. I've had to hand edit out errors before. 

ok, enough rambling. Plus I need to check my procmail recipe to see if I got it right for this list...

This is what I'm using:
# PUt mail from the fosug list into the mailbox ipcop
:0:
* ####@####.####
#* ####@####.#### &lt;-- This wasn't working...looks like this list is setup differently than what I'm used to.
fosug

On another note, is everything wrapping OK for people? Not screwing anyone up am I?

Ahh man, so close on the intelligence thing. ;-) . Hint, take a look
at &quot;set textwidth=70&quot; inside of  ~/vimrc (assuming you are using vi as

Which brings up another point, line wrap, is it really necessary or
even wanted nowadays. Point everybody USE to have 80 col term areas to

$ man intelligence
No manual entry for intelligence

I guess I don't have that installed. Is that avaialble in RPM? ;)

And I need to train myself to use &quot;L&quot; instead of &quot;r&quot;. Ack this is gonna take some training. It's like the new versions of AutoCAD...they've tossed out the body knowledge of the past 20 years and changed everything. You have to completely retrain yourself. Stuff that was just an instinct now you have to think about, or you body will just learn the new way.

The most stupid I've ever felt using a computer was at a drafting competition at Fresno City. Wasn't VICA, but for the Fair District or something like that. Anyways. A group of about 6 of us who were used to using R12 sat down in front of computers with only R10. You entered the system completely different...we all sat there for about 5 minutes going WTF do I do? (We were told we'd be able to use R12 during the competition...) Yeah, we got spanked. LOL.

So in other words I'll leave it alone. :D

Only 6 chars? Is that a Nokia 5100 or 6100? My Motorola v60i does about 20 chars. It uses a proportional font, so it differs. I get weather reports each morning...takes 3 lines for the from address. Mainly because the the first like is &quot;y-&quot;.

<hr><pre>On that line wrap thing with email, let the reading email package wrap
to its display.  I read a lot of email on my Palm and email can get
very chopped up, particularly when forwarded or replied to a number of
times.  Another point on not forcing word wrap that it makes text you
send in an email difficult to cut and paste.  Attaching it in an
unformatted text file sometimes prevent sent mail from getting
through.

<hr><pre>Tip #1:

If you're using vim for your editor, try adding a line to your .vimrc that
looks like this:

set tw=78

This will wrap your lines at 78 characters (this is a netiquette thing).

Another, less friendly way, is to configure mutt to call vim with the parms in
the command line like this (in your .muttrc):

set     editor=&quot;/usr/bin/vim +\&quot;set tw=78\&quot;&quot;

Ick.  You're using mbox format.  That may get pretty ugly over time.  You may
want to bite the bullet now and convert to maildir.  It's a little &quot;less tidy&quot;
but you don't end up with a 10GB mail spool that has to be locked by procmail

I really like the 80 column format (or 78 as I set for myself).

I don't like having to adjust my screen to fit the original intent of the
author for a message.  I also truly despise having to read edge to edge on the
screen when a post is unformatted. It's kinda along the lines of html email.
I don't find it efficient or friendly.

I suppose I can do a fmt on all of my email before I read it.

Seems kinda silly though.

Only down side to this is that textwrap will be on for all the files you edit.
If you're editing scripts, this can become irritating.  I don't know how much
you use vim, but it's pretty much _all_ I use for editing (save web cruft
which get's done in kate so I get the syntax highlighting).

If you choose to go with maildir, yes.  If you want to stick with mbox, no.
It's up to you.  The benefits of maildir for me can be nicely summed up in
that there is no need to do locking so that you can deliver mail _anywhere_
(read non-local filesystems, a la nfs) and when you decide to archive your
mail, you can use 'find . -mtime +30' syntax to make the archives for you.

&gt; which get's done in kate so I get the syntax highlighting).

I thought about that AFTER I did that. Hmmmmm. Maybe I'll go that route. I use
vim for all my text editing, including web stuff (PHP &amp; HTML).

Of course after I sent that I googled it.......
 
&gt; The error was likely a max message size error if you were getting it on
&gt; attachments.  Different MTA's vary greatly in how they handle the bounces for
&gt; message size &quot;violations.&quot;

Actually I'm thinking they may have been blocking ZIP attachments. I remember
who we were sending it to, but not the exact error. Or their server may have
been down. I don't remember it being a size issue. All that we get back the
ISP is that there was a problem. They send you back the first part of the
mail, including the envelope and body. But nothing of what the servers are
saying to each other.

I'm just used to getting mail back that has whatever the error is.

&gt; The benefits of maildir for me can be nicely summed up in
&gt; that there is no need to do locking so that you can deliver mail _anywhere_
&gt; (read non-local filesystems, a la nfs) and when you decide to archive your
&gt; mail, you can use 'find . -mtime +30' syntax to make the archives for you.

I do think I'm going to go to maildir. I like the way that Pine would take an
rotate out your &quot;Sent&quot; file into months for archiving. Maybe I can work on
some Bash or something (or better yet, find it somewhere online.)

I think I'll need to make the change on the Postfix config, mutt, and the
afforementioned procmail recipes. Nice thing is with this moving over, I can
get all this stuff set up on the new box.

Thanks for the pointers.

Even if the meeting is just about getting the group rolling again.
It's been in a lull lately to say the least.

Cheers,

Yea, me too.

As soon as I get the OK and address info for the new meeting place
I'll post the time and map to the fosug site so we can get the ball
rolling. If we can't meet at the new building we'll figure something
else out. We've had suggestions from a few people as to where we can
meet if something goes south.

Shouldn't that be 564 WEST Herndon Avenue, CLOVIS, CA?

<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=564+West+Herndon+Avenue+Clovis,+CA&amp;spn=0.006297,0.020385&amp;t=h&amp;iwloc=A&amp;hl=en">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=564+West+Herndon+Avenue+Clovis,+CA&amp;spn=0.006297,0.020385&amp;t=h&amp;iwloc=A&amp;hl=en</a>

Take Magill from northbound Willow, correct? I don't THINK there is a turn
pocket from southbound. Flip a U-Turn at Sierra.
