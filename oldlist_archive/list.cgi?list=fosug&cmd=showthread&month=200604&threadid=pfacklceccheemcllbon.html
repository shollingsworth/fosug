<hr><pre>It was great meeting a bunch of you tonight!
For those of you who did not make it to the dinner (and for those who  
did but can't let go quite yet), here's a little treat...

Chad - thanks for being a good sport!
Drew - you are next on my hit list...

That rocks! Woohoo Chad. Next stop, runway.

It was great seeing new faces at the meeting. It was nice meeting Suzi
and Mattias  in person for the first time.

I'm really proud of how the group has grown and the diverse skills
everyone represents.

Thanks Mike C, Mike T, Dennis and Ronnie, Drew, Pat, Chad, Mattias,
Suzi, and Michelle for coming.

See you all at the next meeting on May 20th. If you have a place where
geeks mingle at the water cooler, maybe you can slap a flyer on the
wall.

Applebee's is close to where I live, but this was the first time I had been
to that restaurant.  Glad to see some new faces there too.  Looking forward
to Chad's presentation next month.
See you then,
Sanjiv

+1 on all the above.

Maybe it's not bad to start the &quot;restaurant discussion&quot; already?  I
think Applebees was better than Shanghai, but maybe it ought to be in
different parts of town each time? I'm thinking Livingstone's or Million
Elephant (unless they have karaoke on Wednesdays?) would be nice venues
in the Tower area.

<hr><pre>Maybe this says a lot about how much I leave my area of town, but I have
never heard of either of those two places.  I pretty much haven't eaten in
the tower district since Butterfields closed up shop.

<hr><pre>Butterfield's still exists, but under the new name Sequoia Brewing. The
menu is much the same, and the beer is still mediocre. It's still a nice
place to hang out, and their IPA isn't undrinkable.

However, for the best micro-brew in town, there's Full Circle in
Chinatown (on F near Ventura). Not a dinner venue, since they serve just
beer and wines that they make.

Livingstone's is the restaurant next to Starline. A popular hangout
that's been in the same location for many years.

Million Elephant is a new Thai/Lao restaurant in the space that was
previously J-Ho's, and Brix before that. Very friendly service, good food.
