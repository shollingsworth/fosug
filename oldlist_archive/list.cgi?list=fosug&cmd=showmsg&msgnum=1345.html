<hr><pre>It was a bit hard to follow what you were proposing, but I believe you were
proposing a digital blueprint room? Is this correct?

I know that there are 2 electrical and one general contractor &quot;represented&quot;
here. Not on an official capacity, but that employees of those firms are
members of the groups. I can't speak for the general or one of the electrical
contractors, I work for the 2nd electrical contractor, and of course can't
speak officially for my employer.

Is your plan for an archival system with As-Builts? I personally despise
as-builts in general (they are a complete PITA to draw, I should know, that's
part of what I do as a draftsman) and plan archiving is even more of a PITA.
Paper drawings take up HUGE amounts of physical space and are a nightmare to
manage. Currently we store plans in our warehouse (not exactly paper storage
friendly) in a small area, maybe 100 ft^2. Rubber bands last less than 1 year
for the most part out there.

Most digital archiving is done like this. The as-built drawings are supplied
up-stream. Depending on who we are working for, we send the &quot;customer&quot; the
as-builts. This could be to the general contractor or to the owner directly.
Previously everything was done in analoge. We sent paper drawings and
Operation and Maintenance Manuals (i.e. the &quot;Owners manual&quot;). Now we include a
CD with PDFs of the drawings, and possibly of the O&amp;M if we have them. Most of
the lighting submittals are done via PDF now anyways, and manuals for most
equipment as well.

Some developers have even completely stopped keeping paper drawings or
whatever. I know that larging shopping area that's very popular has all of the
paper as-builts drawings scanned into TIFF files and these are kept on DVD.
There's an application that actually catalogues these so you can easily call
them up. The scanning is done via a large format Oce scanner at the
reprographics bureu. The TIFFs can then be sent to the bureu to have copies
made.

At several dollars per scan, it's not something that's in the reach of many
contractors, or they just don't want to put out the money. We looked at an Oce
setup and entry level, was well over $25K. This particular bureu has (2) Oce
9800s that run $65-$100K.

One of the big issues with sending files around, ESPECIALLY CAD files, is data
security. The company that I work for was &quot;ripped off&quot; if you will. We had
sent AutoCAD files to the architect for a job. He then forwarded these files
to an electrical engineer who was doing the design work for the same customer
in another town. This was a building that was essentially a mirror image.

Our plans went through plan check without any corrections coming back. The
architect sent us the backcheck items from this other job as an FYI. (FYI to
him, you're a moron). We got this list and were a bit puzzled why he would do
this. Looking over the list we checked them against our plans. We noticed that
we had some of the exact same errors. Hmmmm.

We were able to obtain a set of the plans from the developer (same developer
on both jobs) and found that errors were near the same, on the same page. To
say this was a copyright violation would be mild. The results were the
arhitect's ties to the developer were severed and the electrical engineer,
without admitting fault/guilt, departed with some funds.

As a result, AutoCAD files are very rarely, and not without good reason, sent
out. Mostly files are transmitted in PDF. Usually if they are, its for working
drawings of proposals. I.e. layouts of electrical rooms, etc. Nothing that you
could do much with. Full sets are only transmitted as PDFs.
