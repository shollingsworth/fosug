How about using what you have above but use a webmin interface to it.
As far as the spamfiltering, you can write a custom cgi-plugin that
will allow users to blacklist or whitelist people themselves.

<a href="http://www.nuclearelephant.com/projects/dspam/">http://www.nuclearelephant.com/projects/dspam/</a>

this is something users can use themsevles to monitor their spam.

But an out of the box distro? No... not really. You're looking for
something more like this.
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/messaging_srvr/index.xml">http://www.sun.com/software/products/messaging_srvr/index.xml</a>

which you'll pay for. But check out the system requirements for
operating systems.

I think it's going to become more and more apparent that we're going
to have to start dipping our toes in the Solaris pool.

If I'm mistaken and some golden savior email distro exists... sweet!
give me the link. Otherwise... how about we create it :-P LOL

This gives you the base install and the basic packages you need plus a method
to automate the install of the other packages you're interested in.

There are several pop toaster sites out there that give a checklist of
installation options.

Another option is to get a golden machine installed and configured for generic
set of packages and scripts and then just dd the entire thing to another disc
in the machine.  Hopefully, this will be kept under a single cd or dvd in size
and then you can dd it from a network location via ssh using something like
bbc.

Just some thoughts.

Something like RedHat/Fedora using Kickstart? The one thing I HATE with FC is
that it installs Sendmail no matter what. Tell it not to, and to install
Postfix...still get Sendmail. Bah!

Nope. The sendmail RPM actually gets installed. You have to manually stop
sendmail, use the switched to activiate Postfix and then uninstall sendmail.

That it is.  Many programs still expect a sendmail binary and its flags 
in order to do command-line submission of mail.  And Postfix's is one of 
the best implementations of those flags I've ever worked with.

I wholeheartedly agree with all three assessments.

All (good-natured) flamebaiting aside, I remember trying to install 
qmail a bunch of years ago before Postfix even came on the scene (even 
when it was known as Vmailer befure it was actually released).  I got 
most of it working alongside my existing Sendmail system in the day. 
However, what  gave me cold feet was that at the time, I didn't have 
anything else to test with and I had to have a working mail server 
system since my system serves quite a few people.  Plus the software 
made me feel very uncomfortable with all those additional userids.  And 
would it work with my existing mbox setup?  My understanding is that 
qmail's default delivery is actually NOT Maildir, but mbox.  And another 
thing I required is that it work with Procmail.

In the end, I got cold feet, then backed the whole thing out.  Given 
what I've heard about qmail (licensing bullcrap notwithstanding), I'm 
glad I did.  DJB was on some SERIOUS drugs if what even HALF of what I'm 
hearing about it is true.  Specifically, if you have one-to-many mail 
going to one given site, a well-designed mailer sends it just once. 
Apparently, qmail delivers it as many times as there are recipients at a 
given site rather than just once.  And just how is this supposed to 
enhance security?  It doesn't give any real benefit, and at the expense 
of additional network utilization.

I dunno.  This software really bothers me, and the guy's philosophies 
bother me even more.

That's because Postfix is intended to be a replacement of Sendmail with more

Yeah, right, whatever.  I've been sitting on my hands since stevo posted this
hoping that someone besides me would be a bit more sensible.  &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; I wholeheartedly agree with all three assessments.
&gt; 
&gt; All (good-natured) flamebaiting aside, I remember trying to install 
&gt; qmail a bunch of years ago before Postfix even came on the scene (even 
&gt; when it was known as Vmailer befure it was actually released).  I got 
&gt; most of it working alongside my existing Sendmail system in the day. 
&gt; However, what  gave me cold feet was that at the time, I didn't have 
&gt; anything else to test with and I had to have a working mail server 
&gt; system since my system serves quite a few people.  Plus the software 
&gt; made me feel very uncomfortable with all those additional userids.  

Are you talking about Postfix or qmail on the user id part?

Postfix requires two groups and one user.  Qmail uses seven users and two
groups.  The user count is higher in qmail but so what?  None of them are
interactive logins and it simply provides greater program separation between
the components of qmail.  This adds security as no program implicity trusts
any other program in the qmail system and only one program runs with escalated
privileges.

&gt; And would it work with my existing mbox setup?  

As for mbox, qmail supports mbox just fine.  It's silly to use qmail with mbox
unless you have client requirements for mbox files.  There are many reasons to
*not* use mbox files, but if you must, qmail can do it just fine (by default
even).

&gt; My understanding is that qmail's default delivery is actually NOT Maildir,
&gt; but mbox.

That is correct.  If you choose not to give qmail direction, you'll get mbox
format in /var/spool/userid files.  I don't see how this is a problem if
you're so fond of sendmail.  Also, qmail gives the user control over what mail
format his mail exists as instead of making the admin choose for all users.

I will never use mbox again if I don't have to because I've been the victim of
corrupted mbox files and had to manually rebuild them.  Maildir (like mh/nmh)
does one message per file.  This has *many* advantages, not the least of which
being that I can use find to sort my mail by date automatically.

&gt; And another thing I required is that it work with Procmail.

preline has been a part of qmail for a *very* long time.  It resolves all of
your procmail issues.  Either your users can do | preline procmail or you can
place that in the global config for each mail delivery.

Again, I don't see the problem here beyond perception.

&gt; In the end, I got cold feet, then backed the whole thing out.  Given 
&gt; what I've heard about qmail (licensing bullcrap notwithstanding), I'm 
&gt; glad I did.  

So, is your problem that it's free, that you're guaranteed to get the same
code no matter where you download it from or that you can't get it in an rpm?

If you've not admined qmail, how can you really have an opinion about this?

&gt; DJB was on some SERIOUS drugs if what even HALF of what I'm hearing about it
&gt; is true.  Specifically, if you have one-to-many mail going to one given
&gt; site, a well-designed mailer sends it just once. 

I don't pretend to know if DJB is a stoner.  However, I do know that there
seem to be a number of seemingly intelligent people out there spreading FUD
about qmail and anything else DJB.  I don't know why.  I just know that most
of it has been either erroneous, irrelevant or a misinterpretation of what
&quot;should&quot; be from my perspective (a good example being next).

&gt; Apparently, qmail delivers it as many times as there are recipients at a 
&gt; given site rather than just once.  And just how is this supposed to 
&gt; enhance security?  It doesn't give any real benefit, and at the expense 
&gt; of additional network utilization.

One-to-many delivery in qmail works as you say it should, for recipients in
the CC field of the mail.  However, for emails that use BCC for recipients,
one-to-many delivery can be done either as a single message with many RCPT TO
commands or as multiple messages:

     [0] Addresses that do not appear in the message headers may appear in the
     RCPT commands to an SMTP server for a number of reasons.  The two most
     common involve the use of a mailing address as a &quot;list exploder&quot; (a
     single address that resolves into multiple addresses) and the appearance
     of &quot;blind copies&quot;.  Especially when more than one RCPT command is
     present, and in order to avoid defeating some of the purpose of these
     mechanisms, SMTP clients and servers SHOULD NOT copy the full set of RCPT
     command arguments into the headers, either as part of trace headers or as
     informational or private-extension headers.  Since this rule is often
     violated in practice, and cannot be enforced, sending SMTP systems that
     are aware of &quot;bcc&quot; use MAY find it helpful to send each blind copy as a
     separate message transaction containing only a single RCPT command.

So as I read the RFC, it says that if you're sending bcc, you may need to send
a single message per recipient to prevent mailers that, 'violate [bcc] in
practice]' from giving out the recipient list.  It sounds like qmail is right
on spot there.

Are you sure you've got this one right?  Can you give me an example?

Maybe you're thinking of the fact that qmail forwards emails via bcc.

&gt; I dunno.  This software really bothers me, and the guy's philosophies 
&gt; bother me even more.

I know that DJB is a bit arrogant, but from what I've seen and done with his
software, he's pretty justified in being so.

As to philosophies, can you be more specific?  I've not really had any
interaction with his philosophies other than how they are interpreted in his
programs.  I'm curious what you're speaking to and why that should keep you
from running his code. [1]

To hopefully put an end to this note, I run qmail and I have run postfix in
the very recent past.  I chose qmail over postfix at this time and place
because I understand it better than postfix and enjoy the flexibility that
qmail allows my admin staff at work.  Postfix's ties to sendmail compatibility
make it more cumbersome for me in the long run.  I think postfix is a fine
mailer and a good choice for many people.  I have found no significant
performance issues that would have me choose one over the other on that
criterion.  I do know that I don't like the way that postfix handles filtering
for spam through an external program although the UCE controls are quite cool.

[1] Let's look at this seriously for a sec.  You say his philosophies bother
you.  Do you mean that since he's a &lt;insert religion here&gt; that you cannot run
his software?  Maybe he's gay or a skin-head or votes green party and that
bothers you deeply.  What on earth does that have to do with the value and/or
quality of his software in the market.

Do you hate Wietse because he's Dutch?
