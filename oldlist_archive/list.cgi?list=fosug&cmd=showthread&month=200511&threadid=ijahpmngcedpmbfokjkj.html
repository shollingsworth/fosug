<hr><pre>I gots me a php issue that is more an admin thing than

This is a script meant to verify my php.ini settings
are working the way they are suppose to.

display_errors and register_globals return a null
value and won't display anything.  I have an open
source application that I am trying to install (OS
COMMERCE) and it requires register globals turned on. 
I turned them on in the php.ini file as well as
display errors (for dev purposes only) but the errors
don't display and either will register globals turn
on.  Can't seem to find much on this issue except to
say  &quot;turn register_globals on&quot;.  I did that and
the're still not on and the php script I am running as
root won't echo what the value is, it will on other
php.ini settings but not those to.  Any advice?

Can you post the resultant output of this script? Read
comments at php.net/ini_get and
php.net/register_globals for clues. 

What web server are you running, sounds like it needs
a restart to reload the settings in php.ini?

Leaving register_globals on can be risky, if it's only
for the configuration, don't forget to turn them off.

Run phpinfo() and see what the settings show. [0]

Of particular interest is that you look at the php.ini file location that your
php is looking at.  There are often more than one location that these show up
in and if you happen to be looking in the wrong location and changing settings
there, you'll develop a flat spot on your head.

If you find that register_globals and display_errors are both off, you've
worked on the wrong ini file.

If you find that you're using the right file on the CLI, and that through your
web server you have the same problem, make sure that there's no settings in
the .htaccess file in the directory you're interested in.

As to the NULL return on the ini_get calls, this is as designed.  If the
values aren't explicitly set in the php.ini file, then you'll get NULL string
returns.  The best way around this is to cast the values as integers when
reading, a la:

  print 'register_globals = ' . ((int) ini_get('register_globals')) . &quot;\n&quot;;

which should yeild the desired 0|1 that you're looking for.

If you don't want to mess with the full-blown register_globals mojo, you can
simply create an include file (or find one that's used by every page) and
place a call to import_request_variables [1] or better yet, to extract [2].

&lt;soapbox&gt;
If you're running an application that still *requires* the use of
register_globals, you should consider another application VERY SERIOUSLY.  
&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Don't worry so much about the script, if you edited
the file and know it's restarted, try the installation
proceures again ... were there any other errors.

&gt; 
&gt; Run phpinfo() and see what the settings show. [0]
&gt; 
&gt; Of particular interest is that you look at the
&gt; php.ini file location that your
&gt; php is looking at.  There are often more than one
&gt; location that these show up
&gt; in and if you happen to be looking in the wrong
&gt; location and changing settings
&gt; there, you'll develop a flat spot on your head.
&gt; 
&gt; If you find that register_globals and display_errors
&gt; are both off, you've
&gt; worked on the wrong ini file.
&gt; 

Use this to find those files:
find / -name php.ini

&gt; If you find that you're using the right file on the
&gt; CLI, and that through your
&gt; web server you have the same problem, make sure that
&gt; there's no settings in
&gt; the .htaccess file in the directory you're
&gt; interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; As to the NULL return on the ini_get calls, this is
&gt; as designed.  If the
&gt; values aren't explicitly set in the php.ini file,
&gt; then you'll get NULL string
&gt; returns.  The best way around this is to cast the
&gt; values as integers when
&gt; reading, a la:
&gt; 
&gt;   print 'register_globals = ' . ((int)
&gt; ini_get('register_globals')) . &quot;\n&quot;;
&gt; 
&gt; which should yeild the desired 0|1 that you're
&gt; looking for.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't want to mess with the full-blown
&gt; register_globals mojo, you can
&gt; simply create an include file (or find one that's
&gt; used by every page) and
&gt; place a call to import_request_variables [1] or
&gt; better yet, to extract [2].
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;soapbox&gt;
&gt; If you're running an application that still
&gt; *requires* the use of
&gt; register_globals, you should consider another
&gt; application VERY SERIOUSLY.

<hr><pre>Yea yea I know rob that register_globals is insecure
and applications that use it are an incident waiting
to happen.  

As to what the MB is, MB = message board.  Sorry at
work I've gotten use to using shorthand.

I did the find thiny and it only returs one awnser,
/etc/php.ini and that is the ONLY file I've been
editin to try to get stuff changed.

As far as errors I try to display what the ini file is
 set to with php to make sure my install is working
and those are the only 2 settings I can't get a value
on, they always come up null, every other setting I
can get a string, boolian, or intiger return on it. 
Quite frustraiting, in the FC4 build it may not be
able to be turned on at all or it could be just a bug
during the install.  Either way that is the only php
application that doesn't work on my distro that I have
found(could be do to bad programming and the authors
of OS COMMERCE just don't want to update the code).  I
found a supposed &quot;fix&quot; but that doesn't work either. 
Also I have a series of apache mods installed
including mod-security, mod-ssl, and son on, the
standard apache install for FC4 comes with all that,
if that helps at all.

I've been considering it a lot and th guy who is
paying me $$$$ wants the application skinned but I'm
just going to reccomend switching applications.  I
hostestly don't want to contribute to a serious
incident waiting to happen.  I'm open to suggestions
as to any open souce e-commerce applications.

Just a shot in the dark, as I've never used either of these
applications, but there is a fork of OS Commerce called zencart
<a href="http://www.zencart.com/">http://www.zencart.com/</a> .  (One of the core developers was interviewed
recently on lugradio www.lugradio.org )
I don't know if this app uses register_globals or not, but it might be
worth checking out.


&gt; I'm open to suggestions
&gt; as to any open souce e-commerce applications.

&gt; 

I've actually set up a Potter with Zen Cart. He uses
it with PayPal, does Verisign over SSL, it's plugged
into USPS and even has templates. One CMS rising in
popularity is Mambo, but choose the solution that best
fits the customer's needs:
<a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com">http://www.opensourcecms.com</a>

If you want this to work for you both, I recommend
letting someone else host it, so you don't have to
worry about the bottom layers,
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp">http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp</a> .
It'll save you unimaginable headches at a cost they
usually don't mind covering. Say Midphase or Prokmu
for example, but there are many more to look at.

Email me off list and we'll go over how it works.
