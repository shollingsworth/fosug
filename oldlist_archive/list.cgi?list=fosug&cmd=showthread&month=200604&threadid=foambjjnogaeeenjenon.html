Welcome to the group Ronnie, we hope to see you at future meetings. You
got the presenters name mixed up with One of the Stevens in the
group :-P Robert Nickel was presenting on RT, and there are two Steven's
in the group, myself (stevo) and Steve Bibayoff, the gentleman you were
sitting next to.

As always, glad to have you.

<hr><pre>Tho not instone I would like to be doing a presentation soon, on vmware.
Which should be userfull and interesting for anyone considering migrating.
It allows you to run linux on windows, or windows on linux at a reasonable
speed.  Vmware is also what is used to creat virtual servers for
presentations and testing.  Roberts Presentation for example used vmware to
creat a fake RT server to use durring presentation.  I know there has been
talk about doing a presentation on it, and since i'm using it every day
right now for a few projects, figured i'd go take the next step. and
document it

Did you want to present on this in June, or possibly get someone from
VMware out to present on this. We can have you present in May, but we
have Chad pegged for that, unless you guys want to switch months.

I'm going to send out a memo, so we can discuss an agenda for future
meetings, and formats on IRC or in person. I figure we should have
meeting topics and speakers lined up three months in advance. Or two at
a minimum.

That's Steve W. Steve Bibayoff is, IIRC, down in LA now. He hasn't been to
FOSUG meetings, that I know of. He was one of the 4 who tried to get FLUG
running, and also tried to get the Linux SIG going with FPCUG with me.

I believe that Rob is trying to get someone from VMWare to actually come and
give a presentation. He's in the song-dance, run-around mode. I think Water
needs to send him to another conference with some VMWare Devs. ;) Worked for
us once...

Right.  Crappy little cell phone.

To add insult to injury, I just ordered another crappy little cell phone for
