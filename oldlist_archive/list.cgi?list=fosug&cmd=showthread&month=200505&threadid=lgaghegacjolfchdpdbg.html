possibilities of Linux
To: Steven Hollingsworth ####@####.####


 
 Linux and Open Source technologies are currently being implemented
industry-wide in countless organizations. If they've already been
implemented at your organization, you'll need to know how it's going
to effect existing technology and what's coming next. If they haven't,
they're coming and you'll need to know what to expect and how to keep
up – either way LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo is where you need to be.

With an expo floor of over 170 exhibitors and over 10 hours of free
educational opportunities where you can hear directly from leaders in
the industry, LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo is where you can get the
information and insight you need to be one step ahead of the game.

This August, join your peers at LinuxWorld and: 
 
 
Explore the multitude of Linux and Open Source solutions available to
you and your organization;
Analyze solutions implemented by organizations currently breaking
ground in utilizing Open Source technologies and understand the
challenges and rewards they offer;
Gain a better understanding of how leveraging Linux and Open Source
technologies can positively impact your company's bottom line – and
what you need to know to make it happen.

It's the event on Linux and Open Source you can't afford to miss –
register today.
