<hr><pre>Stevo,

    Sigh. It was an unmitigated disaster. Drew, Patrick and Chad showed up, 
and Sanjiv was there as well, and I appreciated the support. What we didn't 
know at the outset, was that Linspire had emailed Bill Myers, FPCUG prez, 
that they weren't coming (thanks, Linspire - you have made my decision much 
simpler).
    We goaded Drew into considering doing the Linspire demo himself, since 
he had it in his bag of tricks that he brought to the meeting, but he needed 
internet access, and while his phone had that as an option, it wasn't set up 
for it at the moment. He tried, though, and got it up and running about the 
time the meeting ended.
    In the meantime, our Fearless Leader, Bill Myers, valiantly tried to 
salvage what was left of the evening by showing a demo CD of Microsoft 
Windows Defender and Windows Live One Care.
    Patrick and Drew contributed to the Q&amp;A session very nicely, but I think 
Patrick and Chad got most of their entertainment out of watching Drew 
struggle to set up his internet line before we ran out of time.
    Although I didn't actually do it, the desire to bend over and hit my 
head repeatedly on the table out of embarassment and frustration was almost 
overwhelming.
    So, how was your evening?

Yea, that's a BS thing to do, they should have given more notice than
the same day :-\

&gt;From what I've been reading about Linspire, they're on the wrong track
entirely and have rubbed the open source community the wrong way (not
hard to do)

&gt;     We goaded Drew into considering doing the Linspire demo himself, since

LOL, this doesn't suprise me. Was there any cursing involved? :-P

Right on, I think the reason why they guys were saying yawn was a nod to
linux not having to deal with spyware or viruses.

It's cool Bill could step up to the plate... I imagine it'd be difficult
to give a presentation on something you've never touched before.

&gt;     Patrick and Drew contributed to the Q&amp;A session very nicely, but I think 
&gt; Patrick and Chad got most of their entertainment out of watching Drew 
&gt; struggle to set up his internet line before we ran out of time.

Heh. I probably would have been right there with 'em

&gt;     Although I didn't actually do it, the desire to bend over and hit my 
&gt; head repeatedly on the table out of embarassment and frustration was almost 
&gt; overwhelming.

My evening was OK, I had to work on something after hours which is why I
didn't attend. I wouldn't be embarrassed, it wasn't your fault they
didn't show. Speaking of banging heads on desks, I've been doing that a
lot lately :-P
