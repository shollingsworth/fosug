Hi, all.

Was curious if anyone's been messing around with any of the WRT54G 
distros?  I picked up a Buffalo Technologies router which can take the 
firmware and have been goofing off with it over the last few days.  I 
was wondering if anyone's done the same thing and what your experiences are.

Thanks!

--Ian.

<hr><pre>I am sure Robert will chime in on this one as I think I heard him mention
the software before but I have to put my two cents in here as well.  I own a
linksys wrt54g v2.0 and just flashed this with DD-WRT v23.   I don't know if
any other source code projects are this great or not but I absolutely love
this firmware.  I CAN USE VLAN's ON THIS ROUTER!!!!  That just blows my
mind.  I wish some of the help pages were more up to date in the router as
the manual on the site is in german, but other than that it amazes me what
this thing can do.  Oh yeah.  Before I forget, QoS was the other big one.
You can prioritize traffic.  Need to make sure p2p apps don't suck up your
bandwidth?  This thing does it.  Want to run a hotspot?  This has a
configuration page that will let you set up stuff on it.

I am really curious to see what other versions are out there.  Sveasoft is
supposed to be another one that went commercial with their project and are
charging for the software via a membership or something.  I just stuck with
the dd-wrt fork.  I didn't read too much about the whole situation as I was
just interested in the software.

Right now I am lucky enough to own two of these routers (a friend replaced
his with another brand for some reason) and I flashed the backup with the
DD-WRT and am trying it live for a while.

I haven't set one up personally, but I know that this project:
<a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/">http://www.fwbuilder.org/</a>

has a built in module to help you compile rules for it. From what I hear
the features are awsome. (i.e. what Dennis mentioned)

Though the DD-WRT project does have a &quot;micro&quot; image that'll fit into a 
2-megabyte flash on the v5 WRT54G, though I hear that takes some doing.

That's why I ended up getting the Buffalo WHR-G54S.  It was listed as 
&quot;supported&quot; and has plenty of RAM and flash for a normal distribution 
and some packages,  Not to mention, this and its higher-powered cousin, 
the WHR-HP-G54S, were both on sale at Best Buy this past weekend, $49 
for the WHR-G54S and $69 for the WHR-HP-G54S.

And ASUS put their own GPL code in the ring, notably for multiple SSID 
support (the chip will support up to 16 SSIDs, though all of them will 
be on the same channel).  Though I can't figure out how to VLAN them off 
just yet because I want to use a second SSID for our new roomie and I 
want to give her just Internet access while I give my own SSID access to 
my entire core network.

wrt54gl?

&gt;
&gt; Well, if there's one word of advice when it comes to considering
&gt; Sveasoft as a possible candidate:  Don't.  The OpenWRT project revoked
&gt; their license to distribute because they didn't offer sources.  I've
&gt; also heard horror stories about how if you talk about it on either their
&gt; own or other forums, Sveasoft will suspend access to their own forums.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Right now I am lucky enough to own two of these routers (a friend
&gt; replaced
&gt; &gt; his with another brand for some reason) and I flashed the backup with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; DD-WRT and am trying it live for a while.
&gt;
&gt; The big thing I like about DD-WRT is that you can quickly set up either
&gt; on-device storage (internal flash; beware of wearing out your flash
&gt; chips!), on-device add-on storage (think:  USB storage, like MMC/SD, CF,
&gt; etc), or off-device network storage (SMB, NFS, sshfs).  This will allow
&gt; you to install more and bigger packages and in ways that doesn't kill
&gt; your router's on-board flash memory.
&gt;
&gt; Apparently, even some NAS devices have many of the same chipsets,
&gt; notably from BroadCom.  I see making a smallish Squid server to replace
&gt; my K6 machine which sucks up a LOT more juice.  What'd be even scarier
&gt; is making a smallish &quot;data center&quot; where your big ethernet switch sucks
&gt; up more juice than all your other connected appliances combined!
&gt;
&gt; And I like OpenWRT for its package management system (which can be used
&gt; on DD-WRT as well, though I suspect a lot of the kernel-bound stuff
&gt; might prove to be a challenge both installing and using).  It's
&gt; essentially an embedded system's answer to APT.
&gt;
&gt; In any event, if you can't find a good WRT54G or GS or can't justify
&gt; buying a WRT54GL (which is specifically targeted to folks like us), the
&gt; Buffalo is a great alternative.  There are other routers that will take
&gt; this firmware as well.
&gt;
&gt; The basic message is this:  It's amazing what you can get for $50 or so.
&gt;   Once you flash these guys, you get enterprise-class features for a
&gt; significantly small fraction of the cost of getting enterprise-class gear.

I don't know if multiple SSID is really all that great a bag.  If you go with
openwrt, it has full iptables and you can do mac based filtering. [2]

[1] Read: it stays up, has a web interface, I can add packages to it easily
and I don't have to do the saving hokey pokey to get stuff to stay on the
device.
[2] I don't know if dd-wrt does this or not.  However, filtering based on mac
is going to be similar to ssid filtering but with slightly greater overhead.
I'm not sure if there's an iptables module for ssid filtering either.

Curious, which release of DD-WRT are you using?  I'm using a prerelease 
of v23-SP1 presently.

Here are my thoughts on both distros:

DD-WRT

Pros:

--Easy to install
--Micro edition will install into a v5 WRT54G (though as I'd said, it 
takes a bit of doing)
--Very complete, even if you look at the Micro's feature set
--Seems to be very cutting-edge (though I believe it is indeed much of 
Sveasoft's doing)
--Nearly all features are web-configurable
--Can use OpenWRT's packages
--Well-documented and -supported on forums and wiki

Cons:
--If you want functionality which require additional kernel modules, you 
can't use OpenWRT's packages; you'll have to build your own kernel, 
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
--Web interface seems a bit persnickety at times.
--SSL VPN is still too young, especially on the Windows desktop.  I 
ended up going with straight-up PPTP, which I realize ain't the most 
secure thing in the world, but right now, it's better than nothing.

OpenWRT

Pros:

--Very actively developed.
--Package system
--Well-documented and -supported on forum and wiki
--Very stable and usable

Cons:

--Web configurability is sparse at best, even on standard features.
--Seems a little behind the curve of some of the more advanced features, 
including VPN functionality
--No ability to go into a v5 WR54G (though I wouldn't touch one of those 
to begin with unless I had certain reasons to justify it and I had $50 
to guiltlessly blow)

Both

Pros:

--Telnet accessibility!
--SSH accessibility!
--VPN accessibility!
--The instant I connect to it with telnet, it's like putting a fish in 
water.  Hello, Linux command prompt~!
--Has the ability to, based on hardware, use additional space via other 
means, whether using USB media (flash cards, USB thumb drives, flash 
adapters or even HDDs)
--Brings enterprise-type functionality to the average user, like VLANs, 
routing protocols (e.g. OSPF, RIP, BGP), etc
--Lots of cool apps we all know and love have been ported, even Asterisk!
--You could even replace some of your &quot;bigger iron personal datacenter&quot; 
gear with these little bad boys  Imagine an authoritative DNS server 
which rarely has to deal with moving parts!

Cons (mostly because of the devices the firmware runs on):

--Never enough RAM to run everything you wanted
--Never enough flash to store a whole lot of you want to keep on it if 
the unit travels
--IPsec may take some doing, or gear specifically designed to handle it 
(like one NetGear unit). Some ciphers or lots of tunnels require a bit 
of processing power which this processor may not be up to the task of 
handling.
--No FPU for some stuff which requires hardware FP, like iLBC and G.729 
for Asterisk.

&gt; I don't know if multiple SSID is really all that great a bag.  If you go with
&gt; openwrt, it has full iptables and you can do mac based filtering. [2]

I s'pose there's that.  Though I'd like it to be as transparent to me as 
possible.  Just wanna give my roomie a SSID, if applicable, a WPA 
passphrase or setup for 802.1x, have her boot up and go!  Saves me a lot 
of administrative work (and another outlet so I don't need to plug in 
yet another brick).

I don't remember.  It's been over a year though, so I'd imagine that it's a
couple of versions removed.

&gt; Here are my thoughts on both distros:
&gt; 
&gt; DD-WRT
[... some very good points]

&gt; OpenWRT
[... more very good points]

&gt; Both
[... very good points all over the place]
&gt; Cons (mostly because of the devices the firmware runs on):

If you're really into running LOTS of stuff on this, you can look at either a
soekris box [0] or something a la smoothwall or a m0n0wall [2] platform. [1]

&gt; &gt;I don't know if multiple SSID is really all that great a bag.  If you go 
&gt; &gt;with openwrt, it has full iptables and you can do mac based filtering. [2]
&gt;

&gt; of administrative work (and another outlet so I don't need to plug in 
&gt; yet another brick).

The more I think about this, multiple SSID support is just going to be
implemented via subinterfaces on the wireless interface.  This is non-trivial
but I'm confident that you can figure it out and then give a talk on it at a
meeting. :-)

[1] We just recieved a box from logicsupply.com with preinstalled m0n0wall.
The box is all solid state and has a 1GHz processor.  I'm not familiar with
the wifi capabilities of m0n0wall, but I'm told that it's quite capable.

&gt; If you're really into running LOTS of stuff on this, you can look at either a
&gt; soekris box [0] or something a la smoothwall or a m0n0wall [2] platform. [1]

Thanks, I'll have to check those out.

Also, there's another platform I want to try out mainly to say I have, 
and that's the RouterBoard 500 series <a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://www.routerboard.com)">(http://www.routerboard.com)</a> 
Those look pretty sweet and they have much better ability to upgrade 
storage.  I didn't look very closely on the RAM side of things, however. 
  Though at least with these, you could put multiple radios into the 
device, doing the multiple-SSID thing that way.

I wouldn't be surprised that this is a non-trivial thing to do, 
considering that consumer radios have just one radio, and thus one MAC 
address.  And essentially, that's what they're doing, including 
implementing discrete security models per device (e.g. WPA on one, WEP 
on another, and 802.1x on yet another), as well as AP isolation, but I 
wanted to take it an additional step, securing my wired network from the 
additional subnet I'd be setting up.
