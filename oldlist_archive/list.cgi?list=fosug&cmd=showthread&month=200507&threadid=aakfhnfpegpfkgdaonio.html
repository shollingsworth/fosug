<hr><pre>Okay, the subject says it all, but I had to mention this.

My office is located near the Manchester Mall which is one of FAX's (I
always through Fresno Area Rapid Transit had a much better ring) major
hubs, so almost every morning, when I'm turning off of shields onto
Blackstone, I'm stuck behind a bus.  Every couple of day's I'm behind
a bus with an advertisement for 'Line-X' spray on truck bedliners,
with the word Line-X displayed prominently in a colored oval.

Now, it's usually really early, and I'm not a morning person, (That's
my excuse and I'm sticking to it) but I always find myself really
excited for like .75 seconds while I think, &quot;Cool, a company
advertising LINUX in Fresno, I wonder what that's about . . .&quot;.  Then
I feel like a total moron, because for like the 8th time I've misread
the SAME F-ing advert.

Just thought I'd share my idiocy with the community.

Alright.  Time for a top posting reminder.

If you don't know what it is, please go to:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting</a> or just google 'top post netiquette'.

And for those who might be wondering...

I know that Drew knows better and I will personally flog him at a later date.
