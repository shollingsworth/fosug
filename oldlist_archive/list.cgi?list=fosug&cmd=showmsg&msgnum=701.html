&gt; I trying to apply some open source to a data base project at United Way --

&gt; to create an initial data base for the call center. My plan is to use open
&gt; source. 

I have some questions and comments (imagine that!):

  Q:  Are you being paid for this job?

  C:  If you are being paid for this job and you *know* ahead of time that the
      customer is OSS averse, this could be the last work you do for them.
      If you are doing this pro-bono, when you meet with them to get the
      requirements list, be sure to tell them that you're not interested in
      what software they *think* should run the application, but you're
      interested in what will most effectively complete the job.

  Q:  Is there currently any full-time IT staff at the place?

  C:  If there is, great!  Make sure that you work closely with them (if it's
      not you) and they can do a *ton* of legwork for you in the winning
      management over to being more open (pun, pun) minded.  Additionally, you
      can sell the staffer on learning that OSS stuff if he doesn't already
      run it or, if he does know it, he can help you out.  In either case, you
      should cross-train said individual on what you're doing all along the
      way.
      If there is not, find out what their current infrastructure is like and
      whether or not they're using another RDBMS.  If they've got an install
      of MSSQL already and they're using 200MB of a 50GB server disk drive,
      it's not going to make a whole gob of sense to install yet another RDBMS
      just to get, what is to them, the same effect.

  Q:  If you have no practical background in MySQL, then why do you want to do
      this to them?

  C:  Please understand that I don't think you cannot do it well.  I just
      don't know that it's wise to testbed a production application for your
      first steps with MySQL.  There are a *ton* of mistakes that you'll make
      learning about MySQL (not the least of which is learning the permissions
      system) and it's probably not a good idea to hang those out for public
      viewing at a customer's shop.  Additionally, if you are trying to
      advocate the many benefits of OSS, it would be better to do something
      you're more familiar with so as to increase the likelihood of a
      satisfying experienc on the customer's part.

      This question comes from knowing several people who have some version of
      the following story to tell:

        I have this guy on our IT staff.  He said that he's been running this
        open source stuff at home and told me that we need to run this on
        everything.  I told him I'd think about it.

        Two weeks later, we have an outage for several hours on our &lt;insert
        commodity service here&gt; service.  This has happened in the past, but
        it was part of a larger problem (a la server failure and that was the
        server we run *everything* on) that was difficult.  When I ask him
        about the cause of the problem and when he expects to get it working
        again, he tells me he's installed an OSS server running &lt;service&gt; and
        that it's having problems.

        We're never going to run that OSS crap again.  It's totally
        unreliable!

      Upon closer inspection of the problem, it turns out that the IT staffer
      had decided to *replace* an existing service without fully understanding
      how it worked.  This service was something that the company relied on
      and was highly visible when it went down (my personal favorite here is
      DNS; it's remarkable how many people manage to munge DNS badly).  The
      service that was replaced was now either running on commandeered &lt;sp&gt;
      hardware that had been long ago (and justifiably) retired or it was
      poorly configured and couldn't be restarted as expected.

      If this service was put into a test environment and kicked about for
      awhile and then migrated to non-mothballed hardware, it would be fine.
      The test environment could be used to show management the new service
      performing side-by-side with the current production service and then
      discussion of phasing out the older service could be discussed.  Doing
      this without buy-in from management is fraught with peril and isn't fair
      to the folks you're working for/with.

&gt; I was thinking of Fronting MySQL with Openoffice Base. There is no
&gt; documentation for Base and although the web is sprinkled with references to
&gt; MySQL, one detail is missing -- how to use it. I have a reference manual
&gt; from the MySQL people of almost 1,800 pages. Not there either. I have no
&gt; practical background in MySQL. If anyone can recommend a URL, book or even
&gt; an actual MySQL data base I'd appreciate it. Perhaps there's a better Linux
&gt; solution and that's fine with me.

  Q:  Who will support this application after you leave?

  C:  If you've brought on-board the IT staffer from above (or you're the
      man), the documentation that you've created needs to be reviewed by said
      and you need to revise it until he is satisfied that he can pick it up
      in 6 months and effectively solve problems/train new users.
      All of your documentation needs to specify any assumptions that you have
      at the beginning (like a working knowledge of MySQL) and where to get
      said knowledge (a la page slaps) if it is not had.  This will allow
      management to hire the right person if you are no longer able to help.

There are other things here, too.  Most of them are contained in The Practice
of System and Network Administration book. [0]
