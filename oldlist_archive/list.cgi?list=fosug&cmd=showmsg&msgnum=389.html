<hr><pre>good lord I just read that post. I must be more tired then I thought.
ignore the grammar and spelling. Been up all weekend in mountains
hiking and all that fun stuff I'm a bit out of it.

&gt; have you checked the cable? Many DMA transmition failures can be
&gt; results of a faulty cable. Or attaching the device to a master or
&gt; slave that is not 100% ATAPI complient.  Example. Knock off NEC ZIP
&gt; drive attached to Liteon DVD drive. Zip on master, DVD on slave. DVD
&gt; acts up. However problem is actually with zIp drive not DVD.  The way
&gt; IDE Master/slave works is.  The slave puts on leather and is required
&gt; to ask it's &quot;master&quot; permision to do anything, always terminating it's
&gt; request with a hearty &quot;SIR&quot;
&gt; ummm
&gt; errrr
&gt; heheh ok seriously tho.
&gt; If this is not your setup, still good info to keep in mind. IDE sends
&gt; all signals to the &quot;Master&quot; drive.  If the signals are intended to the
&gt; &quot;slave&quot; device. If the &quot;master&quot; device is in an idle state, it will
&gt; relay the information to the &quot;slave&quot;  Here are some limitations you
&gt; should keep in mind when dealing with IDE.  You will find that they do
&gt; work in other configurations but the only reson they work, is because
&gt; bios's attempt to fix comming wiring problems. They usually will work,
&gt; but at a reduced performacnce or reliability.
&gt; 
&gt; Master/Slave/Cable Select jumpers.
&gt; Never user the Cable Select jumper.  With linux this is not a huge
&gt; problem because the operating system will always access the drive
&gt; using /dev/hda, hdb, hdc, hdd etc. But because windows is a bit
&gt; sloppier in it's drive handling. A hardrive that was originaly
&gt; configured with Cable Select and has windows installed. IF for some
&gt; reason that drive becomes master, Kiss your registry good by. You will
&gt; find your C: drive suddenly something like E: and none of your
&gt; programs will work. Even setting configuration back to the original
&gt; will not fix the damage caused to the registry. Simply way to
&gt; guarantee you won't run in to this problem, is to simply never use the
&gt; cable select setting.
&gt; 
&gt; Drive possision on cable, and type of cable.
&gt; 
&gt; You will notice there are two types of cables. that looks exactaly
&gt; like a floppy cable. 40 wires running down cable.  This cable is
&gt; capable of ATA33 transmition.  This should only be used on CDROM'S
&gt; Currently there are no ATA66 or higher cdrom's or burners, but I have
&gt; seen tape drives that utilize the faster speeds.
&gt; 
&gt; The second cable type is ATA66/100/133. This is the exact cable for
&gt; all three speed  protocols.  Despite what compusa and monster cable
&gt; tell you, you DO NOT need to upgrade your ATA66 cables to a $25 ATA133
&gt; cables when you buy a new harddrive.
&gt; This cable allows for much faster sustained transfers.  Currently
&gt; cdroms do not use ATA66 or higher speeds. However you may use this
&gt; cable on cdroms, you just won't gain any speed benifit.  These cables
&gt; also fold and route easier around tight cases. The only con of this
&gt; cable is it's cost.  ATA66+ cables will run you a few bucks more then
&gt; the older style cables. Again despite what Compusa and monster cable
&gt; tell you, you should still not pay more then $5 for cable.  Unless
&gt; it's some super glowin dark rounded cable.
&gt; here is your cable
&gt; 
&gt; Drive connection.
&gt; 
&gt; MB========SL===MA
&gt; 
&gt; You will notice you cable has two connection close to each other. and
&gt; the third cable is farther appart then the first two.
&gt; 
&gt; Motherboard is ALWAYS the farthest from either connector.
&gt; Slave is ALWAY middle
&gt; Master is always at the end farthest away from the motherboard.
&gt; 
&gt; Alot of bios can virtualy change the pinout to allow for improper
&gt; master/slave placement, but at a cost of performance.
&gt; 
&gt; So if you do it right to start with you will have a higher performing system.
&gt; 
&gt; What drives to connect together on the same chain (cable)
&gt; 
&gt; keep in mind that each channel is only capable of communicating at one
&gt; protocal at time. PIO is a slow older modes that most cdroms use. UDMA
&gt; is a faster mode that harddives use to transfer data. So if you have a
&gt; brand new harddive working at ATA133 and a cdrom running at ATA33, by
&gt; placing them on the same physical cable you force your harddrive to
&gt; run at ATA33 loosing a large amount of performance. Some bios attempt
&gt; to get around this by forcing the higer speed.  The cdrom will make
&gt; alot of errors and require transmision re-requests.  The thinking
&gt; behind this is even with fixing the errors it will still be faster
&gt; then making the harddrive run at ata33. I havn't done any tests to see
&gt; if this works or not, it's just a good idea not to put your system in
&gt; the situation of having to do error correction.
&gt; 
&gt; Match hardrives with harddrives. Preferably the same speed. ATA133
&gt; with only 133's.
&gt; 
&gt; You will notice alot of cd-burners request that you place the burner
&gt; on the same chain as your harddrive to improve disk to disk copies. DO
&gt; NOT DO THIS.  The reason they recomend this is because devices on the
&gt; same chain loose a Massive amount of performance when accesss
&gt; simultaniously.  So doing disk to disk coppies on same chain, may in
&gt; some (especialy older computers) cases lead to bad burns.  By placing
&gt; the burner on the same chain as your harddrive guarantees a higher
&gt; performance on drive to drive coppies, at the cost of lowered
&gt; harddrive performance on a whole. I personaly would take a loss of
&gt; performance when I'm doing disk to disk copies, and maybe have to
&gt; reduce burning speed to compensate, vs killing the performance of my
&gt; harddrive the entire time I use the computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if this helped you, But these are some pet peaves I see all
&gt; the time when working on computers other people built.  Alot of people
&gt; think as long as it works then it's done &quot;correctly&quot;  Just because it
&gt; works, does not mean it's right.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried the following Konsole to see if there was an error message
&gt; &gt; &gt; (see below). Can anyone tell me how to turn DMA on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; linux:/home/fragos # hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; George,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you post the results of:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hdparm -i /dev/hdc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; it should list a few different modes under DMA or UDMA.
