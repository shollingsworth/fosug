<hr><pre>Hey Drew,

Seeing your laptop yesterday has really got me considering getting a
new one.  Yours seemd like it was a great size.  Just small enough to
be portable, but not so small as to be un-useable.  If you don't mind
my asking, about what are the dimension of the computer, and what is
the size of the screen.  I'd like to use it as a starting point for my
potential purchase.

For everyone else, what are your reccomendations/experiences regarding
a good portable computer.  Bellow is a (possibly incomplete) list of
what I think my requirements are:

Requirements:
1. Good portablity / lightweight.  I want something I can put in a
backback or messenger bag without it being obvious I've got a computer
in there.
2. Good battery life.  I really would like a solid 3 hours application
usage without wireless.
3. Decent Linux support.  I don't need any exotic hardware it may have
to work (ie, jog dial, or softkeyboard buttons), but X support for the
videocard would be a real bonus.
4. Integrated wireless that works at least using NDIS Wrapper
5. Onboard ethernet without a dongle.

Nice To Have but not necessesary:
1. Touchpad.  I HATE NUB POINTERS
2. Onboard optical drive.  Willing to sacrifice this for better
battery life / smaller form factor
3. Availabe PCMCIA slot

Oh yeah, and it has to be less than $500 USD.  Just kidding.

Thanks for your time.

All the specs you need + UNIX-based. (oh - not sure about the  
videocard refs you made)
17 inch screens are overkill imHo - the 15&quot; and 12&quot; screens are great  
+ lightweight.
Older models - I would choose PowerBook over iBook for sure - MacBook  
Pro if you want to make your friends jealous. Here are some links i  
found:

Well I had 3 things to consider. 1. Size, 2. Price, 3. Linux Compatability.
 I ended up with a Averatech 3700
<a href="http://www.averatec.com/notebooks/3700series.htm">http://www.averatec.com/notebooks/3700series.htm</a>

The key buying point was the fact it was $750 (not including an surprise
$150 mail in).
My &quot;old&quot; Laptop which I am selling.  was a Toshiba Satalite Pro. NICE
laptop. 15&quot; screen XGA. 1gb ram. 2.7ghz.  Wifi, cdburner, 60gb hdd, upto 4
hours battery time. this guy was more then fast enought to run everything.
ran Gentoo on it, with vmware in background and it flew.  Only problem was
it's not anything close to compact. The new one, actually is a bit slower.

AMD64 3000+ (about 1.8ghz)
512mb (upgradable to 2gb by voiding warranty, you have to dismantle laptop)
80gb hdd.
DVD burner (specs don't say, but i'm pretty sure it is NOT dual layer)
12&quot; screen
nice keyboard, not too tinny.  It has a touchpad (I hate erasers too).
3 usb 2.0 ports.
10/100 Via Ethernet
Modem. (via chipset ac97, there is support in there, but honestly I probably
will never care enought to try and set it up)
headphone and Mic jacks (sound works under linux, Via ac97 audio dirt easy
setup)
VGA port
firewire
1 SD/MM/sony memory stick slot (I have not tested under linux yet)
1 pcmcia slot (tested works fine)
802.11a/g wifi (native linux driveers RA2500, and yes you can snoop with it,
already decoded my first wep key)
weights about 4lbs
Manufature claims 4 hours battery life (so in reality you should halve it)

Both times i've had it under battery power, I get about 2.5 hours, with a
fair amount of cpu utilization.  Lots of compiling, etc.  I just found the
power conserving features of the kernel today and enabled them.  They are
suppost to power down the cpu/pcmcia/etc. when laptop is idle and
automaticaly power it back to full speed when needed. So  far it work, we
will see how well battery lasts with it on.


Quick google search gave me a fairly good feeling of it's linux
compatability.  I brought it home, and figured I would wrestle  with it for
a week and see if I could get gentoo on it, return it if I had too many
problems.  Turned out I had my gentoo system running in less then an hour.
(minus wifi, and 3d accleration)  I was able to just stage 4 my amd desktop.
Dump it on my laptop. and recompile kernel for laptop hardware.  Another day
of playing I got the wifi working, was easy once I found out the exact
chipset, took about 20 minutes to install and compile.

Drawback on laptop.  The Video has nill for 3d accleration. It is a S3
UniChrome.  Looks great in 2d. but don't expect to be playing 3d games with
it. (I don't game on my laptop so not a big deal, but I would have liked to
have nice gl screen savers) My X is running in VESA mode right now.  I have
found linux binary drivers from S3 that I can install to improve
performance, but I have yet to try this. I will update when I get around to
it.


For everyone else, what are your reccomendations/experiences regarding
&gt; a good portable computer.  Bellow is a (possibly incomplete) list of
&gt; what I think my requirements are:
&gt;
&gt; Requirements:
&gt; 1. Good portablity / lightweight.  I want something I can put in a

&gt; 3. Decent Linux support.  I don't need any exotic hardware it may have

so far all the basics are working, the only extra button on laptop is the
suspend button.  Linux see's it as a scancode for keyboard. so you can map
it to whatever you want.

videocard would be a real bonus.




4. Integrated wireless that works at least using NDIS Wrapper




5. Onboard ethernet without a dongle.


no dongle,


Nice To Have but not necessesary:
&gt; 1. Touchpad.  I HATE NUB POINTERS
&gt; 2. Onboard optical drive.  Willing to sacrifice this for better
&gt; battery life / smaller form factor
&gt; 3. Availabe PCMCIA slot
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, and it has to be less than $500 USD.  Just kidding.


close $600 after rebate. OFFICE MAX. in riverpark. RUN RUN RUN. :)
This laptop is being phased out, new model is replacing it. Hence major
price drop.


Thanks for your time.

I would LOVE a 12&quot; power book,  But I would want the intel dualcore vs ppc.
Unfortunatly to get my desired laptop I was looking at close to $3000.  Had
to made a choice.  Pretty apple and empty wallet, or less pretty but
functional clone and less empty wallet. ;)


happy shopping.
