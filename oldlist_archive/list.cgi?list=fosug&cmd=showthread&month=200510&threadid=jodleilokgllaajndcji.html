Hi, all.

Just installed one machine, Kurumi, and another which was actually a 
reinstall, Yuushi, with Ubuntu Breezy.  Both are multimedia boxen, 
specifically, anime screening boxes.

Everything went very smoothly once I realized I had to enable universe 
and multiverse to get things working the way I needed.  Adding 
ftp.nerim.net and I was REALLY good to go (so I can play DVDs and 
anything requiring a Windows DLL to work).  Also added Kubuntu because I 
prefer KDE over GNOME.

The one thing that struck me is that IEEE 1394 and USB 2.0 storage 
devices worked with minimal fuss.  In fact, the bonus I gained was that 
I don't have to worry about mounting the device I plug in; it appears on 
my desktop.  Adding files from those devices is also a snap since any 
devices plugged in have their own &quot;folder&quot; in the standard KDE dialog.

The only thing I don't like is Ubuntu's heavy reliance on sudo.  I 
prefer an actual root prompt personally.  And since I have further 
issues with sudo, I'm not so sure I want Ubuntu running as a server OS. 
  However, for a desktop and a non-mission-critical infrastructure 
machine, it's wonderful.

Overall, Ubuntu looks like a great desktop OS.  For multimedia, once you 
enable and add the appropriate repositories, it's as good as or better 
than Debian.  Further, the KDE build that you can get is rock-solid, 
though Kaffeine, my player of choice, has a few bugs, but that seems to 
be more an upstream problem than anything else.  It has issues in Debian 
as well.

Those're my experiences.  Hope this helps people along!

--Ian.

That desktop thing sounds good after going through
conflicts between UDEV and my no-name thumbdrive. I'm
debating whether to install Kubuntu or SuSE with
apt4rpm on an old box I have.

Ubuntu is a great distro for newbies and experienced guys alike.
Thanks for the rundown Ian, sounds like it's working well for you :-)

Ok.  I've got to know.  What issues do you have with sudo?

As for ubuntu, my Father installed it and gave it a glowing review as well
(he's a n00b).

On the server side, I am very uncomfortable with its security history. 
If I have to assign someone access to the machine even if for a specific 
task, I'd feel far more comfortable if it were someone I could trust 
with full root access.  Granted, there are many other setuid programs 
they could exploit, but this one, by far, has me the most alarmed.

Put simply, sudo strikes me as a potential security nightmare when it 
comes to code audits.  su, on the other hand, is far simpler.  At that 
point, the onus of delegating privileges on the system rests squarely on 
the shoulders of the admin, where it truly belongs.  I can understand 
why some people would use it.  I personally am not one of those people. 
  To me, when it comes to privlege access at the command prompt level, 
it's all or nothing.

On the desktop side, I suppose I could live with it, but that still 
doesn't change my feelings overall toward sudo.

Interesting.  A quick search of CVE puts the vuln count at 10 since 1999 and
two of those are with secondary functions and not sudo itself.

&gt; Put simply, sudo strikes me as a potential security nightmare when it 
&gt; comes to code audits.  su, on the other hand, is far simpler.  At that 
&gt; point, the onus of delegating privileges on the system rests squarely on

&gt;  To me, when it comes to privlege access at the command prompt level, 
&gt; it's all or nothing.

I don't get the code audit portion here.  Can you elaborate on what you mean
by code audit?  

My confusion comes from the fact that su leaves a single syslog entry when
invoked telling you that it was run (somewhat vain, no?) whereas sudo gives
the entire command run, who did it and the current working directory.  The
nightmare for me comes from simply having someone on your system in the first
place.  Auditing a users movements is difficult in the extreme.

&gt; On the desktop side, I suppose I could live with it, but that still 
&gt; doesn't change my feelings overall toward sudo.

I am truly fascinated with this.  I'm not trying to convince you one way or
the other, but I'm *really* curious as to what has caused your dislike of
sudo.

We can take this off-list if you don't want to discuss it here.  I'm easy.  I
just really want to understand.

Please leave it onlist. I am too maybe not seeing all of the benefits
of su over sudo.

<hr><pre>SuSE does a great job of recognizing a wide variety of USB devices
automatically.  This include a number of different card readers, thumb
drives and digital cameras.  It does a great job on the desktop with
KDE.  Configuration issues are minimal, especially once I learned to
trust YaST.  I have limited experience with other distros except
Linspire and Puppy but My satisfaction level with SuSE 10.0 and its
predecessors doesn't motivate me to change.

&gt; &gt; &gt; bugs, but that seems to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be more an upstream problem than anything else.
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; has issues in Debian
&gt; &gt; &gt; as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Those're my experiences.  Hope this helps people
&gt; &gt; &gt; along!

I'll be 100% honest:  I'm cheap, and thus I prefer the 
free-as-in-beer-AND-speech distros, like Debian and Ubuntu, though I 
have actually bought a S.u.S.E. package in the past.  6.4 was the last 
rev I ever bought.  It was pretty decent, exept I was deathly afread to 
build my own kernel on that system.

As for USB, a recent apt-get upgrade broke hot-pluggable drives, though 
it didn't just affect USB, but IEEE 1394 as well.  Seems to only affect 
the KDE side if you apt-get installed kubuntu-desktop.  Apparently does 
not affect a straight-up Kubuntu install (though I need to try an 
apt-get upgrade once I have Kubuntu fully installed on Kurumi, the box 
I'm going to use as my actual screening box).

Can someone please explain the free &quot;as in beer&quot; vs. the free &quot;as in
speech&quot; thing.

I've heard this thrown around way too long to be ignorant of it's meaning.

And yes, I'm too lazy to look it up. Besides, I want to start a discussion.

<hr><pre>This is my take on this: Free as in &quot;Free Beer&quot; is a reference to the fact
that you can download *nix distros free of charge and Free as in Free-Speech
is referenced to Linux giving you the freedom to do whatever you want with
your applications.

Anyone please correct me if I'm wrong....

Thanks,

How did I know that you were going to page slap me LOL.

*ahem* i.e. the disclosure above :-P

Great read.

[humble opinion]
I have a question. Doesn't this sound a lot like Communism, sharing
and caring, what's yours is ours type thing?

Don't get me wrong, I'm all about contributing to the better good,
it's just that sometimes the views that I've seen expressed can, dare
I say waver on the extreme.
[/humble opinion]

Maybe I'm playing the devils advocate by saying that. Because the
computer I'm typing this on has oodles of free &quot;as in speech&quot; software
on it.

Yes it does save a few items.  First, there is no asking of you to give your
existing property over to another's control.  Under the GPL, you can still
hold copyright to your work and at a later date remove new development from
the public eye (Nessus is doing this right now as a matter of fact).

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'm all about contributing to the better good,
&gt; it's just that sometimes the views that I've seen expressed can, dare
&gt; I say waver on the extreme.

The assumption being made here is that communism is, in and of itself, a bad
thing.  The examples had to date were bad because they did not create the
idealistic goal of what communism &quot;stands for&quot; for the people affected.  Quite
the contrary actually.  It has created a two caste society which rewards the
status-quo and punishes anyone who shows initiative.

The bad of communism isn't that the ideal is bad, it's that the implementation
is impossible unless *all* of the parties involved agree to be bound by the
system.  This has proven to be an impossibility for application on the scale
of nations as most the folks looking to implement &quot;the party&quot; for government
are interested in the power and ses communism as a great way to sway idealists
to their side.

Do I think communism as a political scheme is a bad idea?  Absolutely.
Do I think communism as a philosophy is morally flawed?  Not so sure.  I've
been around long enough to see the merits of giving up what you don't need for
those who may have less.  This is referred to as charity when it's voluntary
an communism when it's not.  The difference is in the practice.  This is where
the GPL sits and it walks a fine line.  Saying that software *should* be free
is somewhat risque as it infers that you should be required to make your
software free (communism-like).  However, the GPL requires action on the part
of the  copyright holder to either give over his copyright to the FSF or to
invoke the GPL on his code (charity like).

It's an interesting debate.  One best had in a social setting so that you can
see the red faces of the folks who are philosophically and emotionally
attached to the issue.

&gt; Maybe I'm playing the devils advocate by saying that. Because the
&gt; computer I'm typing this on has oodles of free &quot;as in speech&quot; software
&gt; on it.

Nah.  Nothing wrong with asking.  It's a good way to start understanding what
you may be &quot;voting for&quot; with your usage patterns and advocacy.

I agree with Robert in that the GPL isn't communism, as it isn't required. You
don't HAVE to use the GPL.

&gt; The assumption being made here is that communism is, in and of itself, a bad

I think we need to differentiate communism and totalitarianism. Communism is
an economic model, as is a free market. Totalitarianism is a political form of
government ala democracy, republics, monarchies, etc. A pure form of communism
is probably not attainable, as is a free market. Greed takes over at some
point.

So far, all of the &quot;communist governments&quot; have actually been totalitarian
governments hiding behind a mask of communism. You don't see the leaders, or
their children starving or freezing to death. China is interesting as of late,
that while the governement is still totalitarian, it is allowing some free
market to exist, but in a controlled manner.

Pure democracies are also very hard to do. So in the US we have a
representative democracy. We vote on people to vote they way we would.

&gt; Do I think communism as a political scheme is a bad idea?  Absolutely.

Remember, communism is an economic model. Not a political model.

&gt; Do I think communism as a philosophy is morally flawed?  Not so sure.  I've

I don't know if there are any changes in the new ubuntu but you can setup
root account on it by booting to a cd and setting a root pw. (havn't tried

That is an option. The oo-boon-too users guide
suggests enabling su with `sudo passwd'. The first
prompt is your user password and the next two set your
root pw. I guess that makes it Socialism, the stage

&gt; &gt; representative democracy. We vote on people to
&gt; vote they way we would.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do I think communism as a political scheme is a
&gt; bad idea? Absolutely.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Remember, communism is an economic model. Not a
&gt; political model.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do I think communism as a philosophy is morally
&gt; flawed? Not so sure.
&gt; &gt; I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; been around long enough to see the merits of
&gt; giving up what you don't
&gt; &gt; need for
&gt; &gt; &gt; those who may have less. This is referred to as
&gt; charity when it's
&gt; &gt; voluntary
&gt; &gt; &gt; an communism when it's not. The difference is in
&gt; the practice. This is
&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; the GPL sits and it walks a fine line. Saying
&gt; that software *should* be
&gt; &gt; free
&gt; &gt; &gt; is somewhat risque as it infers that you should
&gt; be required to make your
&gt; &gt; &gt; software free (communism-like). However, the GPL
&gt; requires action on the
&gt; &gt; part
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the copyright holder to either give over his
&gt; copyright to the FSF or
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; invoke the GPL on his code (charity like).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's an interesting debate. One best had in a
&gt; social setting so that you
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; see the red faces of the folks who are
&gt; philosophically and emotionally
&gt; &gt; &gt; attached to the issue.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's true.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I'm playing the devils advocate by
&gt; saying that. Because the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer I'm typing this on has oodles of free
&gt; &quot;as in speech&quot; software
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nah. Nothing wrong with asking. It's a good way
&gt; to start understanding
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; you may be &quot;voting for&quot; with your usage patterns
&gt; and advocacy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; --Robert
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Definately second Robert on that.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Beware the jaws that bite, for they belong to my
&gt; evil attack penguin.

uh oh... you know it's bad when we start mixing geek jokes with politics. :-|
