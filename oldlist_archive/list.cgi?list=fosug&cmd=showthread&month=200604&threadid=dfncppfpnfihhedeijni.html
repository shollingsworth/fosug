Ugh.  Linspire is pretty much evil.  It's really difficult to do anything
with.  If I was going to point a friend at an easy to use installation, I
would point them either to Ubuntu or Mandriva (no order other than reverse
alpha there).  Both do a really good job of hand-holding and support a gob of
devices and can help new folks make the transition to more technical stuff if
they're so inclined.  If not, there's *tons* of support to be had for both and
they can just have what they want.

We have not had the meeting yet.  It's the third Saturday of each month
(that's the 15th this month) and all relelvant info may be found at
<a href="http://fosug.org.">http://fosug.org.</a>

Everyone is welcome.  Please come and be social.  

Of course we'll refund your membership fee of $0 if you leave early.  :)

Hope to see you there!

<hr><pre>My first Linux was Linspire.  My biggest problem with it is that they make
small changes to core libraries that make them unique.  There fore if you
install from another source the libraries might be updated to &quot;normal&quot; Linux
breaking Linspire supplied versions of other applications.  This makes it
impossible to use the latest stable releases of software like Firefox or
OpenOffice.  They don't seem to be in a hurry to make those new releases
available.  They have effectively created a quasi proprietary environment
from open source.  I changed to SuSE which installs just as easily and
allows me to participate in the open source community instead of the
Linspire community.  I will not recommend it to anyone.  Linspire stands
alone in the open source world.  IMHO, its the Microsoft of the Linux world.

    Yes. I don't pick the topics, I just report on them.

&gt;&gt;No linux experience &lt;&lt;

    This is where I am. I've been breathing on the glass of Linux for several years, but am not sure which direction to go. I probably just need to &quot;pick a Linux distro, any distro&quot; and make the plunge, but am hesitant about jumping in the pool - however, I do want to jump, and finally have an extra computer to play with for the purpose.

<hr><pre>Ronnie,

Linux users are frequently true evangelists in what distribution of windows
manager, KDE, Gnome, CLI, ect. ect., they use.  To some extent opinionated.
Open source is a lot more than Linux.  Its the free applications that run on
virtually all platforms and OS's.  The thing to overcome when going to Linux
isn't that its difficult -- it that its different than Windows.  Humans are
so change adversest.  Using the basics is actually easier than Windows.  The
danger comes when you become infatuated with the power underneath and get
into areas that are difficult.  IMHO, the trick to Linux success is small
steps and stick with the GUI for most activities.  One can't help but end up
at the command line because everyone tells them too.  My recommendation is
to learn the command line first by examining things, not by changing them.
Changing will come over time as you understand the foundation and modularity
of Linux.  Even Windows users can benefit from open source applications that
also run on Windows.  In fact that is the path I take my with those that I
support.  Once you're familiar with the applications, a change to Linux is
simple for Desktop users.  As to geeks like me, the easy way is rarely fun
enough.

Not a problem. We can do that.  We have  a pending meeting topic (not official yet) on vmware.  That will let you play with linux in windows. Or vis versa. Run a copy of windows in linux.  You can have something to fall back on.

It's funny we resently were talking about the May meeting you guys were
going to have since there will be a presentation. I had actually thought about
attending. I'm a past member of FPCUG, ca 2000 or so. Tried to get a Linux SIG
going, with Steve B., but it bombed out after a few meetings. I think one or
two people from those meetings might attend meetings. I've seen Dean at a
meeting about once a year.

My take on a particular distro, choose one. I think each user, based on what
they want to do, will find different distributions more welcoming. Until the
last month, I've been a strictly RedHat-based user. I've run RedHat 5.1, 5.2,
6, 6.1, 6.2, 7.2, 7.3, 9, Fedora Core 2, &amp; 3. Recently I've installed my first
Gentoo system and it's happily serving my web site (zero traffic essentially)
and email server (about 1000 messages per day.)

RedHat's distros were a nice secure feeling to me. Popular enough to make it
easy to find 3rd party repositories and packagers for those packages that RH
doesn't support do to legal, ethical and company policy (i.e. CSS DVDs, MP3,
and other media formats.) YUM or apt (I loved apt when it was supported by 3rd
parties). For the most part, installation was uneventful and small changes
were needed for configuration (usually just with services, like Apache(http),
Postfix(email), ssh, etc.

I have to say I learned quite a bit in the last month with the Gentoo server.
Unless one has a strong willingness to learn, probaby not a great starter
distro, unless the user has some UNIX experience. I've kicked the tires and
think I'm about ready to buy in on the desktop.

Unfortunately I don't have any experience with Ubuntu or Mandriva as the
others have suggested. I think the biggest thing that most people might think
they'll have trouble with is the install. It really is as easy, if not easier,
than Windows.

My linux Experience:

Ca '97 or '98 (Egg Head was closing the Fresno store) I picked up Caldera
OpenLinux 1.1 (or maybe 1.2, can't remember). I never could get X set up right
and so I gave up.

Spring '99. I had a nasty crash on Windows. Lost some partitions that were
compressed. Ran to the store to see if I could find utility to fix it,
couldn't find anything but I did pick up a RedHat 5.1 book. On it went.

Since then I've been anywhere from probably 30% to 100% Linux on the desktop at
home. My work pretty much requires a Windows desktop as we run AutoCAD, and
just dropped $6500 on some engineering app today. We're definately not a hard
core Windows shop. It just happens to be what we use.

At the house I currently have 1 Linux desktop (Fedora Core 3), 1 Linux server
(Gentoo 2006.0 based) and 1 Linux router (IPCop). And there's a Linksys WRT54G
that might get flashed to OpenWRT at some point.

I think for anyone to just sit down and say I'm going to switch just because,
is rather difficult. I think task-based switching causes you to learn. &quot;OK, I
want my own web server.&quot; For a standard web site, there's not much that needs
to be set up for Apache to run out of the box. May not be as secure as it
could be, but it will pretty much run. 

I pushed it further this time and set up virtual hosting. I'm currently running 
name-based virtual hosting. There are 3 web sites of which 2 are accessible 
from outside <a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://pmmay.sytes.net">(http://pmmay.sytes.net</a> and <a href="http://nomad-airsoft.sytes.net">http://nomad-airsoft.sytes.net</a> (under 
construction)). The third is running Request Tracker (see the FOSUG home page 
for a link) is running on an internal name. For the most part, they are easy
to set up when you read the manuals, and the Gentoo Wiki. Gentoo does do
things a little different in some areas.

I'm also running my own email server here. There's only myself on it, but I
like it. One of the big reasons I like it is the SSH/Screen combo, see further
down.) It can take a bit to setup correctly. My biggest issue has been that
I'm an OLD DSL customer dating back to PacBell. Finding the CORRECT support
info is nearly impossible. Mail is only accepted for my domain, and email is
relayed back out through PacBell's outgoing mail servers. I've left my
outgoing SMTP traffic blocked with PacBell/SBC/AT&amp;T/Whatever they are this
year. I do this as it's not a big issue to setup in Postfix, and it will
hopefully block anything if some machine gets compromised here.

I used to not be a big CLI person, but I find myself there alot now. I think
one of the things I love most about CLI is ssh and screen. Screen stays
running at all times on the server with the following screens: mail (mutt),
irssi (IRC client pointed at irc.doteltech.com #fosug), tailing the syslog and
maillog in there own screen and a final screen session with just a bash shell
running for whatever.

I log into the server via SSH from wherever, home, work, etc. I just attach to
the running screen session and continue from where I was. Composing an email I
just pick up right where I was. The only time the system is slow is when I've
got the line bogged down at work. Trying to do that with GUI clients could be
difficult.

As far as what's available, I think it's easier to ask &quot;What do you want to
do?&quot; There's been a lot of work lately in the video area as it's become a lot
more popular in general. For years there's been your standard office apps out
there.

I don't think that icking any one distribution is really that good of an idea.
Pretty much all of the apps are available on all of the distros and for the
most part, we've focused as a group on the apps. I think there was only one
distro-specific presentation and that was on Ubuntu. I think most of the &quot;core
group,&quot; those who are at the meetings every month, run Gentoo. I'm kinda the
lone RH/FC guy.

The thing to note is that we are an open source group. Not just specifically
Linux. Many tools are available on Windows, Mac, etc. as well, including this
month's topic of Request Tracker. I definately say come and check it out. Rob
is a great presenter with a wealth of knowledge to share.

Sorry I got a bit long winded and probably rambled.

Patrick

There are better distros out there, one of the current flavors gaining

making the switch from Windows to Ubuntu.

Ok.  I suppose I should've supported my claim there a bit more.  No, this is
not some evangelical rant.  It's quite simply the methodology to updates and
software additions that bothers me.

Linspires support model is subscription based.  The OS itself comes with no
compiler so any software that you'd like to add to the system must come from
Linspire's subscription service.  When you purchase the Linspire OS, you're
not actually purchasing the software, but support for a year.

In addition to that, the &quot;manual&quot; that my father received when he purchased a
Linspire laptop was two pages long (the front and back of a single page),
that's not too good of a thing to do to someone trying to switch to a new OS.

I just find it ironic, I guess, to base a business on GNU software whose
mission is &quot;to preserve, protect and promote the freedom to use, study, copy,
modify, and redistribute computer software, and to defend the rights of Free
Software users.&quot;

&gt;    Of course, off the record, I'd be happy to know why Linspire is &quot;evil&quot;, 
&gt; as well. I'm interested in Linux for my own self as well as in the 
&gt; interests of my job. This month's newsletter allows me to seek my own 
&gt; interests here. &lt;g&gt;

I'm intrigued to see your findings on Linspire.  If you like it or not and
what your impressions of their support are.

My personal experiences ended with telling my father to seek out his local
Linux user's group and find out what they like.  If he used the same
distribution that his user group did to start with, he could learn a ton and
move on from there.  This has worked out well for him and has reduced my CA to
FL support issues.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Everyone is welcome.  Please come and be social.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt;    'Preciate it. I'll try and be there.

&gt; Open source is a lot more than Linux.  Its the free applications that run
&gt; on
&gt; virtually all platforms and OS's.  The thing to overcome when going to
&gt; Linux
&gt; isn't that its difficult -- it that its different than Windows.  Humans
&gt; are
&gt; so change adversest.  Using the basics is actually easier than
&gt; Windows.  The
&gt; danger comes when you become infatuated with the power underneath and get
&gt; into areas that are difficult.  IMHO, the trick to Linux success is small
&gt; steps and stick with the GUI for most activities.  One can't help but end
&gt; up
&gt; at the command line because everyone tells them too.  My recommendation is
&gt; to learn the command line first by examining things, not by changing them.
&gt; Changing will come over time as you understand the foundation and
&gt; modularity
&gt; of Linux.  Even Windows users can benefit from open source applications
&gt; that
&gt; also run on Windows.  In fact that is the path I take my with those that I
&gt; support.  Once you're familiar with the applications, a change to Linux is
&gt; simple for Desktop users.  As to geeks like me, the easy way is rarely fun
&gt; enough.

<hr><pre>Linux is such a large subject that it is best taken in small doses.  The
journey starts with a single step.  Linux users love to help -- its in their
blood.  FOSUG users are no exception.  Another suggestion is
www.linuxquestions.org forums, I for one have over 400 posts helping others
on the their SuSE forum.  The keys to getting help is first asking on the
right forum, a meaningful post title that summarizes the area your
interested in, have a focused question and, provide as much information as
you can can about versions and other related info like what you tried.
Before asking, search the forum for answers.  As a newbie your questions are
often answered.  When you do get answers, consider them all carefully and
choose those that you feel most comfortable with.  Not all help is complete
but most help is well meaning.  Research help before using and try the GUI
solutions first.  Before using a new command line tool, at the least do a a
{cmd} {double dash}help.  man {cmd} can also be helpful.  The research helps
you learn the most from each problem you solve.  Before long you'll be able
to help others with what you've learned.  In some ways, this is the best
part part of Linux.  There are &quot;HOWTO&quot; docs on the net that are useful.
Documentation isn't a Linux strong point, the community of help is.

About the only reason I'd even consider using Linspire is because it's 
based upon Debian, and I've been a Debian user for about six years now. 
  However, given others' remarks, not so much the &quot;subscription&quot; access 
to their archives, but more their subtle changes that make even 
installing from source difficult, I would like to say that I would 
definitely suggest something else, like Ubuntu.

I could not make recommendations of any of the Red Hat derivatives (so 
called only because they use RPM) only because I don't use RPM-based 
distros with any regularity nowadays.  However, I have used S.u.S.E. 6.4 
for a while, which I considered to be the best of the Red Hat derivatives.

My own experience includes Ubuntu (which I use on my anime screening 
boxen, soon to be on all of my desktop systems; I use it mainly because 
it's also based on Debian), Debian (which I use on servers and any boxes 
I do any active dev work on), S.u.S.E., Slackware (currently, the oldest 
actively-maintained distribution), and SLS (one of, if not THE, earliest 
fully-installable distros).

I've used other Unix-like systems, including FreeBSD (which I use on a 
daily basis at work), Solaris, and AIX to name a few.

Anyway, those are my thoughts and experiences.

&gt;&gt;Our group is gender friendly. Don't worry, we are all harmless guys. &lt;&lt;

    That's good to know. Just didn't want to shock you all when I show up. 
It's always pretty hard on the guys at PC Club.

    Well, let's just say that I'm one of those people that doesn't look like

He's cute, but he doesn't know much about computers. I always appreciated 
the guys that caught on to that without a lot of reprogramming &lt;g&gt;.
