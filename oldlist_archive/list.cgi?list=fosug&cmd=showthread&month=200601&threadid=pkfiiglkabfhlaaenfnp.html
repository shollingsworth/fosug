<hr><pre>Does anybody know how to test if an ISP is throtteling  or dropping VPN traffic intermitently?  I was asked to figure out a way to test it and I haven't the foggiest idea how I would even accomplish this.  I have access to a linux server a home and we use SonicWall as our VPN/Firewall gateway appliance.  Employees typically use DSL or Cable internet connections to VPN in.  We don't have issues with Comcast Cable internet at all but a few people are having intermitent VPN issues and they all have Verizon DSL, SBC DSL Employees work without issues over the VPN..  Verizon of course admits nothing. We have plenty of bandwidth to support all of the VPN connections we require as well as in house internet needs (totalling I think about 12 MBPS throughput up and down.)
   
  I'm stumped.

Joel, what port is your home client connecting to on the sonic wall?

I doubt very much they are throttling traffic... but it's going to be
a huge pain in the butt to find out. You'd basically have to set up
some statistical tracking of port badnwidth with say {insert vpn port
here] and say port 80 (which they should let through full bore  24/7.

There are other guys on the list that can probably answer what
programs/kernel modules you'll need more than I can because I really
haven't had a need for some of the tools being I have them in my
canned solutions.

Cheers,

<hr><pre>Works on port 500, we're using VPN over IPSec with our SonicWall.  Any point in the right direction would be helpful.  We don't have a canned solution for this kind of thing and we have quite a few sattelite and people who work from home around California and if the're doing this we need to know so we can avoid them in the future.  Thanks guys.

My company uses a SonicWall VPN router as well.  We've found that any of 
our users who use SBC Global cannot access throuth the VPN, period.  Are 
you using the SonicWall VPN client as well?  If you find a reason for 
this, I'd be very interisted in knowing why they can't connect.

We've had a few cases (only 3 out of many) when a user connects through 
AOL, installing the SonicWall VPN client totally screws up their ability 
to connect to the internet.  (Just so you know to watch out for this...)

<hr><pre>We have a few ppl on different kinds of DSL Providers accounts and they don't have issues because they connect to the IP directly I think instead of using a domain name.   I've scene many isp's that when using VPN connections you have to use the IP instead of the domain name and they set it up that way on purpose.  I've heard of cases of SBC blocking VPN traffic if you have over so much VPN traffic on residential accounts so hopefully that isn't the case.  
   
  Take in mind many other telco's outside of the US are buying software that analizes packets and can be configured to drop VPN, VoiP as well as P2P and torrent packets as well as other packet types.  The best examples I can think of for that are France and China telcos use it because of the monopolies there.  I heard SBC was considering purchasing it but I don't know if they ever did or implemented it.  They may 
   
  We are using the SonicWall client of course and the VPN connection isn't dropping off completely just slowing down intermitently and we only have 5 or less users connected at once through VPN most times.  Many of the applications we use require a constant connection and if it begins to drop in speed or the packets suddenly start to drop off, the connection to the application will drop as well which is where the problems occur.  Only our remote Verizon DSL employees are experiencing this, every body else has some way of connecting without issues.  This is by far the biggest issue with the cooperate IM that we use (Live Communication Server) and other apps as well.
   
  AOL is bad we all know that, it hijacks your system in many ways and they shut off ports when connecting through them, I'm not supprised you're having issues, the fix is don't go with AOL.  AOL = you get pwned!
   
  I'm not sure of the product version you have but ours came configured by default to use VPN over IPSec.  Make sure the clients are pointing to the IP and not a DNS pointer of some kind, change your default port and update the SonicWall VPN clients with the appropriate information and see if that helps Keith.  If yours is limited in functionality for some reason you may want to consider purchasing the new firmware upgrade they have available to give you more features.
   
  I haven't had any issues with SonicWall not working the way it's suppose to and everyone else can use it ok.

<hr><pre>   I've had some problems like that too in the past  !!  Most of the
problems are from the PPoE type of ISP . I have found that they have a
internal IP address on the CPE/DSL router that might be conflicting with
your IP schema on your LAN's  . So I would have (insert ISP here)
configure the router into a bridge and all should be well  . This may or
may not be your problem ... However I just wanted to throw it out there
as a &quot; What if &quot;
