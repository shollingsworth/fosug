I don't really have much  of a choice in operaiting systems I want to work with so I have to  except as is.  It's been quite some time sense I have done this on  a regular basis and I am finding I need to assemble a toolkit for  future use (both hardware and software).  From you guru guys who  do this stuff could you assemble a list of suggions for  hardware/software for me to cary around as well as quick reference  materials that will come in handy.  I need to be prepared for most  situations that might arise.

Software tools:
  o A good live cd.  Something like whax [1] or some other.  If you find that
    you need to diagnose a problem from a client machine, you can boot to a
    known state.  Also, this has pen test utils that you can use if that comes
    up.
  o The windows Free Tool Downloads page [2] is great when you need some weird
    util that you never thought you'd use.
  o Just about every utility from SysInternals [3].  Especially Autoruns [4].
    
Hardware tools:
  o A small toolset including:
      x 2 different phillips screwdrivers.  One 0 size and one that'll fit
        small screws (cannot recall the numbers - I think like a 5 or such).
      x 2 flathead screwdrivers.  Same parameters as the phillips.
      x A complete set of torx drivers (10 and 15 are *very* common).
      x A pair of tweezers.
      x A telescoping mirror. [5] 
      x A flashlight (always carry a spare set of batteries).
      x A tape measure.
  o If you can afford it and have the need, a cable tester is *very* nice.  My
    work has a fluke that does a number of tests.  The most useful of which
    are telling if the wire map is correct and if not, what's wrong and if
    there's a break, where that is.
  o If you need to trace wires, a trace kit is a must.

This is not a complete list, however this is the absolute must haves that I've
seen in doing this sort of stuff.

Good luck.

<hr><pre>For windows systems I recommend:
If you are running linux as your base os on your laptop or whatever you take
with you (you are allowed and given a laptop right???) you might want to
take along VMware and a couple of installations of whatever os you are
troubleshooting.  If you are troubleshooting windows environments you
probably should have a windows OS of some kind.  On that image you probably
want:

SOFTWARE:
1) adminpak.msi (windows server 2003 sp1 adminpak preferably because you can
manage this version and back down to windows 2000 levels with the sp1
version)
2) Windows Server 2003 Support Tools (located on the cd).  Can manage lower
OS versions and domains.
3) Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tools.  Some of them aren't downloadable
online, but get the ones that you can.
4) Putty.  Best functioning windows ssh/telnet client I know of, but there
are probably other users out there.
5) I know most of you out there are partial to Knoppix, but if you desire a
windows version with a lot of cool tools as well, check out BartPE.  Its not
half as useful as Knoppix, but it does have some snap ins to use with
Sysinternals software.  I have already used it to diagnose and extract files
from a virus infected laptop.
6) Ethereal or some other network traffic analyzer.
7) EmergencyBootCD.  Great for resetting account passwords in the SAM if
somebody changed their password and its the admin account or something.
Doesn't happen often but its nice to have on hand when it does.  Search
google for EBCD.
8) CD's for just about any software you will touch.  You never know when the
client will discover theirs got legs and walked away.  Don't forget that
their are two kinds of windows server CD's.  The single license version and
the corporate version.  The cd's are not usable with keys from the other
type, so you will need both.
9) If you are going to touch Exchange 2000/2003 at all, grab the ExBPA,
ExPTA, ExDRA and ExMON tools.  They will let you check Performance,
Troubleshoot, Recover, and Monitor (only monitor user usage).  I only manage
my one domain so I have installed the Exchange Management tools on my laptop
as well.  I don't think that will work for a setup where you are hopping
around from site to site though, but let us know if it does.
10) A cd with service packs on it and drivers for hardware you use
frequently (IE Intel Nic drivers and such).  Don't put it on the USB stick
as you will want to have that mostly free for temporary file transfer and
other uses.


HARDWARE:
1) what robert said. + Leatherman with aaa flashlight on the holster.  Its
good for most quick fixes and a leatherman gives you a couple of blades to
cut with as well.  Plus its always at hand, which is key for a tech.
2) yeah, I recommend an taking a fluke with you too if you can get your
hands on one (beg, borrow or appropriate).  Even if you THINK you make good
cables, like in my case, you can still find out that one cable doesn't quite
make the grade (raises hand) when running a wire test.
3) Crossover cable.  You never know, and that is the hard part about picking
equipment to take: you end up needing everything.
4) RS-232 console cable.  Get the blue one that Cisco uses to plug into a
serial port on your end and a rj-45 on the other end.  If you troubleshoot
cisco products you should have an extra one laying around somewhere as they
seem to come in every single box.
5) At least one long (20-30 foot) network cable.  Its a pain to make one
when you find out that you need one and have to stop to do it.
6) USB memory key.
7) Camera.  We like cool pictures :)
8) USB Floppy drive and if you can swing it a USB DVD/CD-RW.  You never know
when it will come in handy.
9) Extra Blank CD's
10) Cable cutters and a crimping tool for making and repairing cable ends
(plus rj-45 heads)
