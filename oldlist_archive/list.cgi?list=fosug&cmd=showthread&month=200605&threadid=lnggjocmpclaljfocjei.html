<hr><pre>Hi everyone,

Power outage season is here. The first outage just happened to us this  
morning (in the Alluvial/Willow area of Clovis), and well, it's always  
a little iffy when a running computer suddenly loses power.

I'm no sysadmin, and no expert on file systems either, so I'm not very  
familiar about how robust the ext3 (for instance) file system is in  
these cases. Is the data recoverable in &quot;almost all&quot; cases? As for  
MySQL, I think tables can become corrupted if the system loses power  
in the middle of a transaction. A &quot;repair table&quot; seems to fix it but  
it's an interruption.

Yes I know, backups are always a good idea.

We're running a couple of desktop systems in our office/living room.  
No power-hungry servers, and nothing that can't be &quot;off&quot; for the  
duration of an outage.

So, I started looking for cheap, low-budget UPS packages. Any  
recommendations? Anything worthwhile in the $25-$50 range? All we  
really need is something that can maintain power long enough to shut  
down the machines in an orderly fashion, although it would be really  
nice if the UPS would cause the machines to shut down automatically  
rather than having to do it manually once the UPS starts beeping...

Is UPS yet another area where I need to check for Linux hardware  
support before buying?

Many questions. TIA for any pointers.

Mattias

PS. Thanks to Chad for the MySQL presentation last Saturday! I work  
with MySQL every day but I couldn't have done half as good of a  
presentation. We need more MySQL-savvy people in our area so this was  
a great start.

<hr><pre>Mattias,

I've had pretty good luck with the low-end APC models. I have a BackUPS-ES
750 and a BackUPS RS 800 supporting a few machines at my apartment. Each is
supported by the free apcupsd (www.apcupsd.com) (OSS, works on FreeBSD, I
can only assume it also works on Linux). I think the hardware cost me
something like $70 or so.

If you have old UPSes (doesn't really matter how old) laying about (working
or otherwise), APC has a cool TradeUPS program. You buy a new UPS from them
at a decent discount, and send the old unit back to them for safe disposal.
I'm pretty sure they pay for return shipping.

Cheers,
Sean

<hr><pre>Thanks, Drew and Sean.

So I hear good things about APC? Looking around on the various  
retailer sites I don't see anything about serial connectivity (only  
USB) in any of their UPS's or their competitor's (Belkin is what I  
found).

Wonder if 350 VA is going to be enough for a desktop, a flatscreen  
monitor and a laptop? Probably not. Between the thumb and forefinger,  
does 500 sound like enough?

I've got APC BackUPS Pro 650s on all the machines at work. Server (P3-800 3x
10K SCSI, no monitor) is on a SmartUPS 1000.

I have a BackUPS Pro 420 or something at home that isn't enough for the Athlon
850 MHz space heater + 17&quot; monitor. Or the battery is toast again. It pretty 
much shuts off immediately on power failure.

I have pretty much always gotten 3 years out of batteries, unless they are
used heavily and drained way down.

Oh there is one thing that will trash a UPS: removing the neutral on the line
side power. No, I did't do it. No, they weren't salvagable...I tried. LOL.

One guestimate. Add up the watts of all of your stuff that you want backed up.
Divide that number by .8. Use that number for the VA size. (For those wonder
WTF the .8 means, it's the power factor that UPSes are at.) You do lose quite
a bit of power to heat in the conversion from DC to AC.

As for montiring software, I've always used APCs software, Powerchute.

&gt;
&gt; I have a BackUPS Pro 420 or something at home that isn't enough for the Athlon
&gt; 850 MHz space heater + 17&quot; monitor. Or the battery is toast again. It pretty 
&gt; much shuts off immediately on power failure.

Hey that's a really handy product adviser/selector there, Patrick... I
punched in some numbers and it gave me these  suggestions:

BE500R for $60 (500 VA, 300W -- interesting difference!)
BE500   for $110
BE 650R for $80

Does the Powerchute software run on Linux? And does the USB connector
work easily with Linux? The BE500R, for instance comes with USB only...

On a side note, I wonder why desktop/server power supplies don't just
come with battery backups in them? The computer runs internally on DC
(9V?), the batteries provide DC. This all seems to work fine on laptops
(when the batteries work, that is). A UPS has to go through the extra
conversion from the battery DC power to AC output. (Only to be converted
back by the computer's own power supply).

Maybe internal battery UPS's would deliver longer uptime and less
complicated technology since everything would be DC and low-voltage? Do
they exist at all?

Thanks again,

Mattias

<hr><pre>I'm using an APC 350 VA connected via USB to my desktop machine.  My
monitor and any peripherals are NOT connnected to battery backup, but
are surge protectes.  Once this was done, I installed the APCUPSD
package (in debian) which monitors signas from the UPS.  With a little
help from the readme I was able to setup the config file in a couple
of minutes.

As a result, this is what I get.
When power is first lost, the machine does nothing.  If power is not
restored within 60 seconds, (or the battery reaches &lt;50% charge
remaining), it runs a script that ssh's to my file server (which is on
a dumb APC unit, along with the switch that connects the two machines)
and shuts it down, then proceeds to shut itself down.

I believe I saw the 350 at office depot on Shaw and Brawley for ~$30
on tuesday. (might be after rebate)

Also, compusa has the 800 on sale for like $80 after rebate

&gt; So I hear good things about APC? Looking around on the various
&gt; retailer sites I don't see anything about serial connectivity (only
&gt; USB) in any of their UPS's or their competitor's (Belkin is what I
&gt; found).
&gt;
&gt; Wonder if 350 VA is going to be enough for a desktop, a flatscreen
&gt; monitor and a laptop? Probably not. Between the thumb and forefinger,
&gt; does 500 sound like enough?

&gt; &gt; heck, if you have old ups's laying around grab one. Buy the
&gt; &gt; replacement batteries from Advantec.  Only thing that goes wrong with
&gt; &gt; thoes are the batteries.  Try to get one that uses a serial
&gt; &gt; connection, vs, a USB.  some USB's do not follow standards and are a
&gt; &gt; pain to get to work correctly in linux (or windows for that matter)

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've had pretty good luck with the low-end APC models. I have a BackUPS-ES
&gt; &gt;&gt; 750 and a BackUPS RS 800 supporting a few machines at my apartment. Each is
&gt; &gt;&gt; supported by the free apcupsd (www.apcupsd.com) (OSS, works on FreeBSD, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; can only assume it also works on Linux). I think the hardware cost me
&gt; &gt;&gt; something like $70 or so.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If you have old UPSes (doesn't really matter how old) laying about (working
&gt; &gt;&gt; or otherwise), APC has a cool TradeUPS program. You buy a new UPS from them
&gt; &gt;&gt; at a decent discount, and send the old unit back to them for safe disposal.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure they pay for return shipping.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Power outage season is here. The first outage just happened to us this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; morning (in the Alluvial/Willow area of Clovis), and well, it's always
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a little iffy when a running computer suddenly loses power.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm no sysadmin, and no expert on file systems either, so I'm not very
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; familiar about how robust the ext3 (for instance) file system is in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; these cases. Is the data recoverable in &quot;almost all&quot; cases? As for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; MySQL, I think tables can become corrupted if the system loses power
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the middle of a transaction. A &quot;repair table&quot; seems to fix it but
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it's an interruption.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes I know, backups are always a good idea.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; We're running a couple of desktop systems in our office/living room.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No power-hungry servers, and nothing that can't be &quot;off&quot; for the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; duration of an outage.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So, I started looking for cheap, low-budget UPS packages. Any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations? Anything worthwhile in the $25-$50 range? All we
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; really need is something that can maintain power long enough to shut
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; down the machines in an orderly fashion, although it would be really
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nice if the UPS would cause the machines to shut down automatically
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rather than having to do it manually once the UPS starts beeping...
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Is UPS yet another area where I need to check for Linux hardware
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; support before buying?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Many questions. TIA for any pointers.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; PS. Thanks to Chad for the MySQL presentation last Saturday! I work

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a great start.

Yeah it is. I actually used it to spec a UPS for a breathing machine for my

Yes it does. It's cross platform. Runs on pretty much all of the UNIX and
Unix-like platforms out there. And can be cross-platform. I.e. monitor UNIX
hosts from Windows clients. They have a couple different versions. I used the
old version that wasn't cross-platform.

I used to hear really good things about NUTS <a href="http://www.networkupstools.org/.">http://www.networkupstools.org/.</a>
You can monitor on one system, with several connected to the UPS and shut all
of them down.

I have no idea on the USB setups. I would assume that APCs software would work
find with it. Note, that it's not FOSS, if you're pedantic in your software
usage. My UPSes are all serial. (I believe they actually pre-date USB
connections on UPSes, or were just starting to show up.)

And I was actually way wrong on the power factor. It's actually .6. 

&gt; 
&gt; On a side note, I wonder why desktop/server power supplies don't just
&gt; come with battery backups in them? The computer runs internally on DC
&gt; (9V?), the batteries provide DC. This all seems to work fine on laptops

&gt; back by the computer's own power supply).

PCs are 12V, 5V and 3.3V. So it is possible. The power supply would need to be
MUCH larger than they currently are. Or the battery would need to be
piggy-backed. 

The closest I've seen to this is some mini-ITX cases have a 12V power supply
for running off of say a car (for use as Nav, DVD, MP3, etc.) There was a brick
type external power supply, like a laptop, ink jet, etc.

&gt; Maybe internal battery UPS's would deliver longer uptime and less
&gt; complicated technology since everything would be DC and low-voltage? Do
&gt; they exist at all?

One would think so. you lose a ton of power to heat, etc. with UPSes.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
