Hi, all.

Curious, what does everyone do for wireless under Linux?  In my 
experience thus far, Linux's wireless support is nothing short of 
abysmal.  Maybe I'm buying the wrong gear  For now, I'm using a Trendnet 
SiS 163u-based USB dongle, for which I use ndiswrapper 1.11.  I also 
have a Belkin F5D7050 v4000 which is based on the ZyDAS zd1211b chip, 
for which there is source, but it needs LOTS of work.  For an AP, I'm 
using a Belkin F5D7230-4 v5000 because that was all I could afford until 
I get a suitable LinkSys WRT54G(S) so I can put Linux on it.

Any ideas/thoughts/whatever?

Thanks!

--Ian.

<hr><pre>I'm using D-Link PCMCIA card (DWL-G650) for my laptop, with ndiswrapper.
Works fine with Mandriva 2006. Since the card has the Atheros chip, I
could use madwifi but I haven't gotten around to installing it.

Definitely do your homework before purchasing wireless cards for Linux.
Same goes for modems and maybe other peripherals, too. I can't use the
color printer at the office because I can't find a driver for it.

*nod*  There are some difficulties with linux and wifi vendors.  Why this is,
I'm reluctant to speculate about.  However, that said, I have a Cisco Aironet
350.  Great card.  Support under linux is great.  Best thing of all with the
350 is that it scans all available channels simultaneously when in promiscuous
mode.  That's right boys and girls, no channel hopping.

As for the atheros chips that were mentioned, I also have a proxim external
antenna model.  If you're looking for something strictly as a client, it's
great.  If you want to sniff your lan for troubleshooting, skip it.  I
couldn't even get the card I have to switch to promiscuous mode.

&gt; For an AP, I'm using a Belkin F5D7230-4 v5000 because that was all I could
&gt; afford until I get a suitable LinkSys WRT54G(S) so I can put Linux on it.

Can't help too much here.  I have a WRT54G at home (beware model 5, can't get
linux on it - see <a href="http://www.wrt54g.net)">http://www.wrt54g.net)</a> and a Aironet 1200 at work.

&gt; Any ideas/thoughts/whatever?

Look to the source young man. [0]  Most of the well supported wireless devices
are listed there.  Once you find a card that meets the specs you want, buy it
online and save yourself the grief of the local hardware vendors.

If you're source averse (but I don't get that impression), you can look
through the kernel build menu under net/wireless and see what the comments
there have to say about support.

More than that.  I need either FOSUG's or Fresno Anime's (which I 
personally run, interestingly enough, with a Linux box, even the 
screenings themselves!) schedules to change.  Both are on the third 
Saturday of each month... -.-;;;

Heh, funny you should say that, I have an Aironet PC4800 at work (this 
was before Aironet was bought out by Cisco).  I guess what you said 
tells me that I should keep this as something in my toolkit. :)

So I'd heard about model 5.  I gather I'm better off picking up either a 
WRT54GS or GL or a prior rev if I can find one.

Yeah, I'm definitely not source-averse.  Though on the machine I wanted 
to set up with wireless, I was actually trying to keep the development 
toolchain installation to a bare minimum (which was preferably nothing 
at all, but now, I have little choice; this box is my settop/anime club 
screening box).

In the meantime, I'm at least happy with what I presently have.  All I 
have to do is wait on newer firmware for my Belkin and/or just buy a 
different AP, especially a nice, Linux-capable one.

What's sad (or funny, take your pick) is that my Belkin stick AND Belkin 
router were having communications issues, even under the &quot;ideal&quot; 
situation (stick running under Windows). However, I'm not returning 
either device for various reasons, even though both represent money spent.

In the meantime, I'm using an 802.11b AirPort base station which seems 
to be working out fairly well thus far.  Plus I've played my fansubs 
over 10 megabit ethernet in the past (though the &quot;past&quot; was &quot;four years 
ago&quot;), and most fansubs don't venture too far into 1+ megabit territory 
(including sound)..

&gt;
Wireless vendors are very reluctant to release the specs for their 
radios because they are almost all software controlled  which can 
broadcast at frequencys and power outputs that are not within the FCC 
specs. 

Sadly it's getting worse too especially if you want to use a mini-pci 
internal radio.  HP and IBM (others too I'm sure) are both being forced 
to comply with some FCC policies that require the laptop to only boot 
with a &quot;certified&quot; radio and antenna combination.  If you swap out the 
mini-pci card for a linux/bsd compatible card then the laptop will 
refuse to boot, this check is done by the bios so it's not something 
that is easy to hack around.  I have an HP laptop that I've attempted to 
get a non-certified radio to boot with and it's not been fun.  I've put 
the project way back on the burner and I'll pick it up again later.  To 
sum it up you have to change the vendor ID for the card and then hack 
the drivers.

If you want a working card buy something older that is based on the 
Atheros chipset if you want the best Bsd/Linux support.  The NDIS 
Wrapper project works from what I've heard but you will not be able to 
do any wardriving or any of the fun stuff :(.  Also check every spec on 
the card before you buy it you're going to need to know which hardware 
revisions for sure because sneaky vendors like to change chipsets 
between versions.

Yeah.  Check the wrt54g.net site when you get ready to make a purchase and
you'll know where all the bodies are buried.  Those folks are pretty on top of
the whole bit.

*nod*  When in this situation, I keep the whole toolchain on an NFS mount.  I
turn it on when I need to build and then off when I don't.  Export the
relevant bits into the shell (a la build a .mybuildsh file on the nfs
partition that you source before starting your builds).  This may be slower
than usual, but it gets the job done.  In the case you have where you're doing
screenings, I can't advise the other method of just compiling everything to
386 compat mode.

From what I understand, although not blazing fast, the AirPorts are quite
