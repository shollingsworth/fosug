&gt; &gt; This is *not* a new idea at all.  The idea of ASP (application service

&gt; &gt; actually done anything about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I never said it was *new*, I just thought this would be a good thing.
&gt; I like the idea of standards in productivity software across
&gt; platforms, including various *NIX platforms.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion the implications could drastically change the face of IT
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Web programming in the next five year. Let's see, shall we?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;yawn&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Your lack of sarcasm befuddles me. LOL

LOL.  I'm mellowing in my old age.  Still hopefull that you don't hate me for
the argument.  I do so love our chats.  I yawned due to the fact that this was
the &quot;next big thing&quot; 5 years ago and Billgatus was pontificating on the death
of the ISP in favor of the ASP.  Was he entirely wrong?  No.  Do I think that
ISPs will die in favor of mega corp domination of the physical infrastructure?
It looks like it's going that way.  Will ASPs be the new competition front?
Only if you have tank-loads of money and can convince folks you're trustworthy
enough to safeguard their data.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone else have paranoia about this?
&gt; 
&gt; Paranoia? No. But I must say doing the whole Minority Report thing
&gt; albeit with a browser doesn't sit too well. Privacy is a big deal to
&gt; me, however being surrounded by this stuff makes it hard to avoid.
&gt; Now, some versions of software are &quot;free&quot; with advertisments. And they
&gt; charge for the software if those ads dissappear. Why would that be
&gt; different.

Specifically that they shouldn't be able to tap into your other usage of the
computer to target ads at you.  The fact that this could be done quite simply
without the knowledge of most folks is a difficult trinket to resist.
Especially given google's proven ability with data mining.  Couple that with a
nice bauble - say a nice productivity suite for free and some disk storage -
and people will overlook the EULA that says their privacy isn't theirs
anymore.

&lt;entering the dark scary mind of FR - please hide the kids&gt;

&quot;Um, no, your Honor.  I was just trying to find out what thermite was because
a friend of mine had mentioned it.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Oh.  *His* name?  Well... um... why?&quot;

&lt;/bring the kids back out&gt;

Anyone else thinking McCarthyism?

&gt; Besdies if I was running productivity software, I wouldn't necessarily
&gt; want to use a google, or sun server, but install the app on a local
&gt; web server so my information isn't exposed to the public net. Or at
&gt; least much less exposure anyway.

I think this is better done with any number of corporate solutions, a la
Novell Zen for Desktops.  The cost is not bad when compared to manual
installation on several machines (I don't actually know what the &quot;break even&quot;
point would be, but imagine it can't be much more than about 10) and the
feature set extends across your enterprise and not just to a single
application (or suite of applications).

Besides that, how does google/sun make *any* money by allowing you to run the
server hosting/serving the data and applications?  

The last time I looked at the ASP business model, they leased you applications
that you used and then had to lease again for the next &quot;time period&quot; based on
your usage requirement.  The thought being that you always get the newest
release of the software and only pay as you need the software (M$ was betting
that nobody could live without Orifice).  The two problems I see with this
format are: 1) the assumption of high speed bandwidth for the &quot;entire&quot;
installed base of the M$ Orifice suite, and; 2) the belief that people are
willing to wade through the upgrade process *more* frequently than they do now
for incremental increases in functionality.

For point one, there is definitely a better business case today than five
years ago, but the SOHO space is still fluctuating between hi-speed and dialup
internet.  As for the home user, dial-up is still the big winner just from the
infrastructure standpoint.

On two, if you're not using broadband, are you going to wait for the download
each time there's a bug fix/enhancement to the code?  What if you're paying
line charges as a business?  Do you want to upgrade everytime the feature set
changes?
