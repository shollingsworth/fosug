<hr><pre>Hey guys,

I wanted to get a thread going about what we talked about next meeting.

A.) We're definitely going to do elections, this next meeting, so I
need to get the list of nominees from a few meetings ago when it was
discussed. I'll send out another email regarding this, and post
something to the site.

B.) I assume Drew is going to start back on the beginning Linux series.

Either that or we have an install fest / Q &amp; A session every other
meeting. Let me know what you guys think.

I know there are a lot of people that JUST want questions answered
rather than go over things that some of us may already know, and get
bored.

C.) Did we take notes on the General Session topic suggestions for
next meeting? If so what were they and who wants to present?

Hope everybody is well.

Hey Michelle! Welcome to the group.

I posted the next meeting date and time to the fosug site.

<a href="http://www.fosug.org">http://www.fosug.org</a>

Saturday - November 19th @ 3pm

<a href="http://www.fosug.org/~stevo/it-clovis.jpg">http://www.fosug.org/~stevo/it-clovis.jpg</a> here is a map in case you
don't know how to get there.

Feel free to post any questions you have about linux or the
applications you're using. There are a lot of guys here that know what
they're doing (except for FatRob) and if they don't know the answer
they'll give you a link to a page that does (except for FatRob)

Hope to see you at the next meeting :-) It'll be nice to have a cute
geek girl around to mix things up a bit :-P

~stevo

PS: Just kidding about Rob... I'm just poking fun because he has a
tendency to do the same with me :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is that the correct date/time? I though that
&gt; &gt; the meets were moving to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second Saturday.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, it's been the third saturday of each month
&gt; &gt; as far as I can remember.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless I've been braindead this whole time,
&gt; &gt; which is entirely possible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; :-P

&gt; &gt; &gt; You're right. 3rd weekend. Can't be the 2nd

&gt; &gt; &gt; people the 2nd weekend. :D

I've been looking into it. Right now, my experience
with Samba is with server level authentication,
roaming profiles, home directories, printer and driver
serving. At the moment, I'm familiarizing myself with
the intricacies of wedding Samba with a 2003 Active
Directory.

From what I am hearing, you can have a Samba DC, but
you still have to have Windows installed on another.
Will they replicate? I'm barely reading up on meshing
PAM, winbind and Kerberos. Crazy LDAP.

Does anyone know of a project aimed at duct taping any
number of the steps?

I'm in the process of reading of the Samba HOWTO book...about 900+ pages. :D
I'm halfway through it. Per the docs, Samba can only authenticate to the AD
tree. It doesn't completely integrate with it. You can't replicate, etc. Even
with NT, 2000 etc. You can't mix Samba and NT 4 for example in a DC and
Back-up DC.

I agree, any ideas? Or are we doing a Q&amp;A / Installfest again.

I'd like to see a presentation on getting a VNC Video or Shockwave Flash
with audio up. I'm kinda of working on it myself to give the users
tutorials on how to do certain things.
