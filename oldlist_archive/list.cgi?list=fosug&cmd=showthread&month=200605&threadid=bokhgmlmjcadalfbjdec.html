<hr><pre>Curious, have you tried using this on the standard x86 suse?  I know
development on the x86_64 packages and drivers is SERIOUSLY delayed, and

version of linux untill drivers and applications become a little bit more

&gt; I'm running SuSE 10.0 x86_64.  I just bought a pvr 150 and well to replace
&gt; my WinTV Go which worked well. I find that SuSE has some ivtv code my retail
&gt; DVD but still doesn't support ivtv. I heard that SuSE 10.1 will properly
&gt; support ivtv. I've tried to get mine working as well. Interesting is that in
&gt; addition to the driver, firmware is required. I assume that downloads into
&gt; the card. I've made quite a bit of progress including the apparent download
&gt; of the firmware. At last it will scan for channels but never finds any. YaST
&gt; autodetected this card but wouldn't let me configure a tuner like with bttv.
&gt; I don't know if that represents a problem or is just the nature of ivtv. I'd
&gt; love if someone can help me. I've attached all I've done in hope that
&gt; someone more experienced with ivtv can see my problem.  Thanks in advance
&gt; for any help you can provide.

<hr><pre>Drew,

I've been running SuSE 10.0 x86_64 for a couple of months with success,
including with my older bttv WinTV GO.  All of that even worked 64 bit with
with Ubuntu Dapper Drake beta.  The ivtv pvr I just installed and works with
neither but I have placed my diagnostic effort with SuSE KDE because I'm
more familiar with it.  SuSE appears to run both 32 and 64 bit apps with the
x86_64 kernel.  Part of the distribution is 32 bit and there are two sets of
libraries -- /lib and /lib64.  I find much of what I've read on the web
about 64 bit to be inconsistent and frequently not agreeing with what I see
working.  To be honest I'm a bit iffy on 64 bit myself.  They have done
something to facilitate mixing 32 and 64 but chroot hasn't been mentioned.
I know I can run a 32 bit kernel but as an old development engineer it seems
a little sacrilegious and a waist of the new horsepower I purchased for a
kick in performance.  My use of Linux is both production and learning.  I
prefer not to take the easy way out regardless of how sensible that approach
may be.
