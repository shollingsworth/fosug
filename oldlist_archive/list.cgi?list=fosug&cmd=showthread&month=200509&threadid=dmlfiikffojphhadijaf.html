<hr><pre>FYI : Some advice about supporting  port 587 operations with Postfix,
namely some configuration directives:

  <a href="http://www.irbs.net/internet/postfix/0110/1396.html">http://www.irbs.net/internet/postfix/0110/1396.html</a>

I'm not a wiz with postfix, enough to intepret that page into an
expression, here. Hopefully, it will make sense to any Postfix 
administrator, who would have to work such directives into a sites'
Postfix configuration.


This message is made in response to a new policy of SBC/Yahoo, about
port 25 SMTP -- their having decided to block such, reportedly,
when any SBC/Yahoo user would connect to an MTA not of the SBC/Yahoo
nework.

I'd tried to introduce the matter, in previous messages on the
list. I'd wanted to try to conclude this matter of port 587 and Postfix.

<hr><pre>I'm going to reply here to this message instead of the other ones. SBCIS has
been blocking outgoing SMTP (TCP/UDP Port 25) for several months. I used to
send such small amounts of mail I didn't know about this for a few months
until I looked at my logs...Yeah, I know Bad Admin, no cookie for you.

Anyways, this is completely Opt-Outable as noted in the SBC message you posted
earlier. You just need to configure your Postfix (or other MTA) to relay
outgoing mail through SBC's SMTP servers. It's a one-line fix. Of course,
depending on how old your account is (mine dates from pre-sbcglobal.net
####@####.#### account...)) and the info on their site is incorrect for some
people (like me.)

Basically they are trying to stop the email worms that go out and ravage the
Internet via SMTP. That should work, until a worm can actively search in IE/OE
for the &quot;Outgoing SMTP server&quot;. At which time, something new will need to be
tried. Probably on to using authentication for relaying. I know my ISP has
this enabled.

Also, this fixes the issue with some mail hosts not accepting mail directly
from dymanic IP addresses, cable ISP IPs, etc., ala AOL. I think SBC gladly
replays all mail sent to their SMTP servers via their own networks, no matter
the content. They don't care what the FROM or REPLY addresses are. I still
receive mail on 25 w/o problems (as well as 80, 22, etc.).

As far as the government, specifically the FTC, RECOMMENDED that ISPs block
outgoing port 25 and direct users to specifically using the ISP's outgoing
SMTP servers. This was not a rule that the ISP must do this, just a measure
they could take.

Here's a Slashdot article about this, however, the linked CNN.COM article is
gone:
<a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=150605&amp;threshold=1&amp;mode=nested&amp;commentsort=0&amp;op=Change">http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=150605&amp;threshold=1&amp;mode=nested&amp;commentsort=0&amp;op=Change</a>

As for actually stopping spam, hard to say. The spammer can just send through
their ISPs SMTP server. Though, I'm sure it would be noticed quickly and said
user would probably be banned. Not that that would ever stop them.

All good points Pat. I completely agree. I use an outgoing mail relay
in all my home postfix configs. It's just easier that way.

Yup, once I got the CORRECT information from India...err...SBCIS Tech Support
it worked like a champ.

If you need to be sending directly to other SMTP servers, you shouldn't be
using a dynamic account anyways. Get a &quot;real&quot; account with static addressing
and reverse DNS that's assignable and what not.

OT: How's that $60,000 going? I don't think I could get my boss to pop for $6K
in gear at one shot. :( Though, we're going to need to a new WAP soon. The
WAP11 is dieing. Just keeps rebooting itself. Mine did that as well. I want to
go with something that does IPSec over the wireless to the inside. Firebox
looks about like $700 I think.

What you are suggesting is an IDEAL solution.  In my case, I happen to 
have the access necessary to implement it for myself (working for an ISP 
has its perks).  Most people do not have this.

I'd certainly like to know which ISPs anymore will give you both 
capabilities, i.e. static IP addresses (which, alone, you should 
consider yourself quite fortunate to be able to get) and assignable 
IN-ADDR.ARPA (which is even rarer).

My concern was that there may be circumstances that would require that
an SMTP server (other than one of SBC) would be used as the
next-in-line MTA. 

I suppose this would be relevant only when one would be using an MTA
of an agency or employer other than SBC.

As far as consumer ISPs, probably none. Though SBC does sell their Pro or
whatever DSL that is static IP (up to 4, IIRC). It's around $50 now, I think.
Was roughly $100, but they've dropped their prices faster than people are
dropping SCO products... ;) Whether they will set up the DNS fully, hard to
say.

Going into a business class ISP with a T1 or better, you can pretty much get
all of that. My friend is about ready to have to do this and they have a T1
from AT&amp;T with another company hosting his web site and DNS. Not sure what all
happened, but he had an open proxy up for about a week and didn't know it. Now
he's on some RBL or something that won't take him off until all the DNS is set
up a particular way.

Full service ISPs are out there, just be prepared to pay for it.

<hr><pre>I work for a VISP and we have to deal with all of the
big name ISP's who block port 25, including other
visps.  We didn't use to have that many customers who
block port 25 but now most of our brands inpose some
sort of control, either requires SMTP authentication,
port 25 blocking, pop before smtp scripts, or a
combinaition of the above (makes it difficult
sometimes to help people getting relay access denied
errors, especially if they are extremely dense).  As
an alterantive way around it for people who can't get
real addresses they user use ESMTP (port 587) or set
up port 2525 (We have a few brands that do this,
especially for domain hosting customers who have to
use SBC or Cox Cable as their broadband provider) for
standard SMTP service.

We block people frequently for attempting to send spam
( on purose or through mass emailing worms ).  If we
find the spam is deliberaite then the account is
canceled PERIOD, and not even our subsidiary companies
will host them again.

I hope better methods will exist in the near future to
find out who is sending this spam and which virus's
are sending them.  I've scene lots of incoming spam
products that are great.  Does anybody know of any
OUTGOING spam filtering for unix based systems that
work well (other then the standard limiting of
recipients and how many emails at once and per hour as
well as scanning outgoing messages for known virus's).

I would be interested in this solution if anybody has
one.

Actually, I will put my two cents in.  I apologize for any line wrappage.

Here's my port 587 config for my own server:

submission       inet    n       -       n       -       10
smtpd
                 -o content_filter=
                 -o 
smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_au
thenticated,reject
                 -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
                 -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
                 -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=

Very simplistic since I know that I'll permit anything from my own IPs 
and IPs I completely trust carte blanche, allow anything which has an 
actual account on the server THAT HAS BEEN AUTHENTICATED FOR.  The rest 
are told to shove it where the sun don't shine.

I'm not all that concerned about ETRN, though I really should turn it 
off for port 587 per RFC 2476.

Although I do not know of anyone implementing such a creature, it would make
sense that you could implement an outbound bayesian filter much the same as
your inbound filter.

Ideally, you train this on all mail leaving your domain before you apply any
other rate-limiting techniques, recipient counts, etc.  I don't think you can
blatantly block using this, but you get a feel for what your user's email
looks like to the bayesian engine and spam flagged emails are either, 1) a new
customer who writes like absolutely nobody else or 2) a spam email.

Unfortunately, you would have to be _very_ liberal in your abuse policy and
use this more as a flagging technology than anything else.

One of the most novel ideas that I've seen to date is that those who have 25
blocking and an open relay mail server setup (for their ip space only, of
course) is that they take the connection information for each SMTP transaction
and embed it in the headers of the mail.  This lets them backtrace the mail
vital information to a SP controlled time/date stamp and an IP address.  At
least this eases the abuse complaint handling process.
