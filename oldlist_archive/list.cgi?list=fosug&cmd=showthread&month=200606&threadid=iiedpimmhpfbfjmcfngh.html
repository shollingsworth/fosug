That would be July 15th @ 3PM.

3rd Saturday of each month. I'll update the site soon. Did anybody
discuss a topic for next meeting. Sorry I couldn't make it on Saturday,
I was sick :-(

Was last Saturday. Sorry we didn't put much up about it. Drew presented on
VMWare. I taped it and am working on it at home. Trying something a little
different. Not totally happy with the video. There's a lot of pulsing, like
maybe from the projector. Like a bad flickering old magnetic flouresent
fixture.

Well see how it turns out.

Pat: you using dvgrab and kino to pipe the video to raw mpeg?

Drew: I've tried doing what you stated above and it didn't work out so
well for me. Do you have any tutorials on how to do that?

That's kind of what I was doing. What my idea is to when the person is
talking, at times switching to the slide. (That's why I asked for your
presentation.) The biggest thing I'm having issues with is converting the
images from 640x480 to 720x480 to match the video (and be able to make DVDs
for our non-teathered friends.) Having issues with ImageMagick compositing the
640x480 slide image on top of a background image.

But having VMWare record what's on-screen would be nice too.

What would be REALLY nice would be:

1-2 cameras recording the presenter
Digitally record the presentation audio[1]
Use the presentation slides
VMWare video if appropriate

[1]This would require some really clear sound. Either through a digital sound
recorder capable of up to 2 hrs of recording or a really nice soundcard, mic,
etc.

I've got the video grabbed (dvgrab). That was the easy part. I loaded them up
in Kino to just get a basic layout. Then I got Drew's presention, exported to
PDF, then pulled apart the PDF to PPM files. Right now I'm stuck on resizing
the PPMs to full frame NTSC. :( When I composite them, I end up with garbage.

I was hoping to do it in ImageMagick because it's scriptable and easy. Should
be able to just pop in the frame on top of the background image and use
'-gravity center' to get it there. But it's going horribly wrong. Kinda looks
like a scrambled cable signal. Even worse.

I think I might install Cinellerra and see if it will do it for me.

See my other post for why I'm doing this.

The reason for going to PDF them PPM is because I'm lazy and didn't want to
save each frame of the presentation individually. I couldn't see how to output
each frame in batch other than PDF. :/

Let's shoot for August for the video one if we want. I'm not sure if I'll be
in town for July or not yet.

Let's see, I know, bad geek but be in Fresno in July or over shooting people
on the Monterey Pennisula. Hmmm.

We were all wondering where you and Dennis were. Sorry you missed it.

Low turnout though. 8 or 9 people.
