Trend Micro AV Ushers Hackers Right In 
Severity: High 

25 February, 2005 
Summary: 

On Wednesday, Trend Micro quietly released an alert describing a
critical buffer overflow vulnerability affecting 29 of their antivirus
(AV) applications. By sending an e-mail containing a specially-crafted
attachment, an attacker could exploit this flaw to execute code and
gain total control of any machine running Trend Micro AV. Since AV
software scans incoming files automatically, the attack can succeed
even if the victim does not interact with the malicious e-mail. If you
use any of Trend Micro's AV products, upgrade the application's scan
engine to VSAPI version 7.510 or higher immediately.
Exposure: 

In an alert released yesterday, ISS X-Force warned of a new buffer
overflow flaw that affects most of Trend Micro's antivirus (AV)
products. The flaw resembles the Symantec flaw X-Force reported on two
weeks earlier. According to Trend Micro's advisory, the buffer
overflow results from their scanning engine's inability to properly
parse ARJ files having overly-long filenames. ARJ is a special
compression format used to make files smaller for easy archival.

By sending an e-mail containing a specially-crafted, ARJ-compressed
attachment, an attacker can exploit this buffer overflow to execute
code on any computer running Trend Micro AV software. Since AV
software scans incoming files automatically, it is feasible for the
attack to succeed even if no one interacts with the malicious e-mail.
Once the infected e-mail is received at a valid address on your
network, the attacker could obtain full control of a victim's PC
whether or not anyone opens the booby-trapped e-mail.

This flaw presents a critical risk. Imagine if an attacker sent a
specially-crafted attack e-mail to your entire organization. If you
use Trend Micro's Gateway AV solutions, the attacker could gain
control of your gateway AV server and all your clients in one sweeping
stroke.
Solution Path: 

Upgrading to Trend Micro's scanning engine VSAPI 7.510 or higher fixes
this problem. If you use any Trend Micro AV products, visit their Scan
Engine Update page and download and install the appropriate update
immediately. 
For All WatchGuard Users: 

Although some of WatchGuard's Fireboxes can mitigate this risk by
helping you to block e-mailed ARJ files, we highly recommend you
update your Trend Micro scan engine immediately in order to fully
protect yourself from this vulnerability. Nonetheless, if you want to
block ARJ files with your Firebox in the interim, see the details
below.
Suggestions for Firebox II / III / X owners 

With a Firebox II, III or X you can use the SMTP Proxy to block ARJ
files temporarily until you apply Trend Micro's update. Keep in mind,
this procedure blocks both malicious and legitimate ARJ files. You
might want to reverse this procedure, allowing ARJ files once again,
as soon as you install Trend Micro's new scanning engine.
If you have configured an SMTP Proxy
In the WatchGuard Policy Manager, double-click the SMTP Proxy icon. Click the 
Properties tab. Click the 
Incoming button. Click the Content Types tab. Make sure that the &quot;Deny
attachments based on these file name patterns&quot; list includes *.arj. If
you do not see *.arj in the list, click the
Add button and add it. 
If you have not configured an SMTP Proxy
In the WatchGuard Policy Manager, select 
Edit &gt; Add Service. Expand the 
Proxies folder. Double-click 
SMTP. Click 
Add. Click 
OK. Then follow the steps above. 
Suggestions for Firebox Vclass owners 

The default configuration of the SMTP-Incoming proxy action strips all
files but: *.doc, *.txt, and *.xls so ARJ files shouldn't get past
your proxy. However, you can use the procedure below to ensure the
proxy strips *.arj attachments.

Make or change a custom proxy action based on SMTP-Incoming to strip
*.arj files. If you made a proxy action based on SMTP-Incoming, you
can edit it so that it strips all of these attachments. In the
Vcontroller software, click the
Proxies button. Double-click your custom proxy action. On the Content
Checking tab, change Category to
Attachment Filename. Click the 
Add to Top or 
Insert After button. Only one option appears in the dialog box. Type
ARJ_files as the rule name. Select
Pattern Match. Next to Pattern Match, type *.arj. Select 
Strip as the Action. Apply the new Proxy Action to your SMTP rule to
make sure that the Firebox strips ARJ files.
Status: 

Trend Micro's scan engine VSAPI 7.510 fixes this issue.

FYI, In order to update your scanning engine you must manually update
as Trend Micro has not updated thier automated downloads.
