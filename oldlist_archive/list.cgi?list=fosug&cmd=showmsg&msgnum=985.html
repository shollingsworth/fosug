&gt;    I am the new editor of the Fresno PC Users Group newsletter, &quot;The RAM 
&gt; Pages&quot;. In May, our general meeting will be about &quot;Linspire&quot;, a flavor of 
&gt; Linux. I'd really like to have some input by way of an article from this 
&gt; group on what you like about Linux in general, how Linux has become easier 
&gt; to install/use, the wide range of applications available for home and 
&gt; business. . .anything that can spark the group's interest in any Linux 
&gt; distribution.
&gt;    If I can wrangle an invitation, I'd also like to sit in on your meeting 
&gt; this month, if you haven't already had it. . .

&gt; FPCUG Newsletter
&gt; <a href="http://fresnocomputerusers.org/newsletter/apr06.htm">http://fresnocomputerusers.org/newsletter/apr06.htm</a>

It's funny we resently were talking about the May meeting you guys were
going to have since there will be a presentation. I had actually thought about
attending. I'm a past member of FPCUG, ca 2000 or so. Tried to get a Linux SIG
going, with Steve B., but it bombed out after a few meetings. I think one or
two people from those meetings might attend meetings. I've seen Dean at a
meeting about once a year.

My take on a particular distro, choose one. I think each user, based on what
they want to do, will find different distributions more welcoming. Until the
last month, I've been a strictly RedHat-based user. I've run RedHat 5.1, 5.2,
6, 6.1, 6.2, 7.2, 7.3, 9, Fedora Core 2, &amp; 3. Recently I've installed my first
Gentoo system and it's happily serving my web site (zero traffic essentially)
and email server (about 1000 messages per day.)

RedHat's distros were a nice secure feeling to me. Popular enough to make it
easy to find 3rd party repositories and packagers for those packages that RH
doesn't support do to legal, ethical and company policy (i.e. CSS DVDs, MP3,
and other media formats.) YUM or apt (I loved apt when it was supported by 3rd
parties). For the most part, installation was uneventful and small changes
were needed for configuration (usually just with services, like Apache(http),
Postfix(email), ssh, etc.

I have to say I learned quite a bit in the last month with the Gentoo server.
Unless one has a strong willingness to learn, probaby not a great starter
distro, unless the user has some UNIX experience. I've kicked the tires and
think I'm about ready to buy in on the desktop.

Unfortunately I don't have any experience with Ubuntu or Mandriva as the
others have suggested. I think the biggest thing that most people might think
they'll have trouble with is the install. It really is as easy, if not easier,
than Windows.

My linux Experience:

Ca '97 or '98 (Egg Head was closing the Fresno store) I picked up Caldera
OpenLinux 1.1 (or maybe 1.2, can't remember). I never could get X set up right
and so I gave up.

Spring '99. I had a nasty crash on Windows. Lost some partitions that were
compressed. Ran to the store to see if I could find utility to fix it,
couldn't find anything but I did pick up a RedHat 5.1 book. On it went.

Since then I've been anywhere from probably 30% to 100% Linux on the desktop at
home. My work pretty much requires a Windows desktop as we run AutoCAD, and
just dropped $6500 on some engineering app today. We're definately not a hard
core Windows shop. It just happens to be what we use.

At the house I currently have 1 Linux desktop (Fedora Core 3), 1 Linux server
(Gentoo 2006.0 based) and 1 Linux router (IPCop). And there's a Linksys WRT54G
that might get flashed to OpenWRT at some point.

I think for anyone to just sit down and say I'm going to switch just because,
is rather difficult. I think task-based switching causes you to learn. &quot;OK, I
want my own web server.&quot; For a standard web site, there's not much that needs
to be set up for Apache to run out of the box. May not be as secure as it
could be, but it will pretty much run. 

I pushed it further this time and set up virtual hosting. I'm currently running 
name-based virtual hosting. There are 3 web sites of which 2 are accessible 
from outside <a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://pmmay.sytes.net">(http://pmmay.sytes.net</a> and <a href="http://nomad-airsoft.sytes.net">http://nomad-airsoft.sytes.net</a> (under 
construction)). The third is running Request Tracker (see the FOSUG home page 
for a link) is running on an internal name. For the most part, they are easy
to set up when you read the manuals, and the Gentoo Wiki. Gentoo does do
things a little different in some areas.

I'm also running my own email server here. There's only myself on it, but I
like it. One of the big reasons I like it is the SSH/Screen combo, see further
down.) It can take a bit to setup correctly. My biggest issue has been that
I'm an OLD DSL customer dating back to PacBell. Finding the CORRECT support
info is nearly impossible. Mail is only accepted for my domain, and email is
relayed back out through PacBell's outgoing mail servers. I've left my
outgoing SMTP traffic blocked with PacBell/SBC/AT&amp;T/Whatever they are this
year. I do this as it's not a big issue to setup in Postfix, and it will
hopefully block anything if some machine gets compromised here.

I used to not be a big CLI person, but I find myself there alot now. I think
one of the things I love most about CLI is ssh and screen. Screen stays
running at all times on the server with the following screens: mail (mutt),
irssi (IRC client pointed at irc.doteltech.com #fosug), tailing the syslog and
maillog in there own screen and a final screen session with just a bash shell
running for whatever.

I log into the server via SSH from wherever, home, work, etc. I just attach to
the running screen session and continue from where I was. Composing an email I
just pick up right where I was. The only time the system is slow is when I've
got the line bogged down at work. Trying to do that with GUI clients could be
difficult.

As far as what's available, I think it's easier to ask &quot;What do you want to
do?&quot; There's been a lot of work lately in the video area as it's become a lot
more popular in general. For years there's been your standard office apps out
there.

I don't think that icking any one distribution is really that good of an idea.
Pretty much all of the apps are available on all of the distros and for the
most part, we've focused as a group on the apps. I think there was only one
distro-specific presentation and that was on Ubuntu. I think most of the &quot;core
group,&quot; those who are at the meetings every month, run Gentoo. I'm kinda the
lone RH/FC guy.

The thing to note is that we are an open source group. Not just specifically
Linux. Many tools are available on Windows, Mac, etc. as well, including this
month's topic of Request Tracker. I definately say come and check it out. Rob
is a great presenter with a wealth of knowledge to share.

Sorry I got a bit long winded and probably rambled.

Patrick
