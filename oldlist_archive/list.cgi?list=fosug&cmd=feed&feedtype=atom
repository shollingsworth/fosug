Hi All,

I'm curious, has anybody else seen brute force login attacks like these
over the past few weeks?

It seems to mostly come from China (big suprise) and they stop after 2 -
4 hours of guessing the adminstrator password.

    We used to be not-so-cool people, but nowadays it's a good idea to be 
nice to your local geek at all times. You never know when they've got to 
pull your bacon out of the fire.

&gt;&gt;Very cool Ronnie! Give us a rundown on anything cool you come across :-)&lt;&lt;

    With regard to the VMWare, or to Linux? Both are Star Trek projects for 
me still.

&gt;     OK, I just loaded VMWare (evaluation) and loaded Ubuntu under that, on my new AMD64 machine. I wanted to get set up and have time to play before Drew's demonstration. Very, very cool!     The newer computer lets me use the newer Linux versions, (Ubuntu 6.06) so I can get a better idea on how the regular version of Ubuntu works. Had a few small hangups in the installation, but it was pretty trouble free. I plan to explore more, later, but so far it looks very good.

Friday, July 28th, 2006, is the 7th annual System Administrator  
Appreciation Day.
On this special international day, give your System Administrator  
something that shows that you truly appreciate their hard work and  
dedication.

http://www.sysadminday.com/

If I had a brazillion dollars I'd buy each and every one of you a Mac.

As a consolation prize I promise not to say bad things about you  
behind your backs.
