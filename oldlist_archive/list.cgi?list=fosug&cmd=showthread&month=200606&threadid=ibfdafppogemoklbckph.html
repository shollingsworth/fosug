<hr><pre>IMHO

I've been running a 64 Bit kernel for some time but a couple of weeks ago
decided to to try dual booting with a 32 Bit kernel.  Both are Ubuntu 6.06.
Now with a little direct experience I can make a reasonable comparison.  As
a user I can't discern a difference in speed although I've not tried any
objective measures.  Over time I got most things to work with the 64 Bit
Ubuntu  but still flash evaded me.  I haven't yet tried the chroot jail
method which should work.  With the 32 Bit kernel I rapidly past the
complement of software on my 64 Bit kernel.  Before Ubuntu I'd been a
devoted SuSE user for some time -- SuSE 10.1 drove me away.  I will give
SuSE credit for making 64 Bit operation in a mixed 64/32 Bit environment
more transparent.  As an old geek of many years, the thought of running a 32
Bit OS on a 64 Bit machine seemed almost blasphemy.  I've been very focused
on Linux for the desktop and have helped many make the transition to Linux.
At this time, I recommend to new and experienced users Ubuntu 6.0.6 32 Bit
as the OS of choice.  It's much simpler for me to support users on 32 Bit
Ubuntu and they can focus more on the use and not the facilitation of use.
Although running dual boot 32 and 64 Bit Ubuntu, my own default boot is the
32 Bit version.

Interesting.  Do you have a 32-bit or a 64-bit data bus? I also suspect
that a lot of programs you're using still haven't been ported to 64-bit.

Maybe it's an ignorant question but what sorts of applications or
daemons/services would benefit most from a 64-bit architecture?

I thought the idea of 64-bit was that the processor can work on larger
chunks of data in one step. but I wonder how often is that needed in
practice? I could imagine that graphics programs like the GIMP would
benefit, as it processes large amounts of binary data.

Floating-point math seems to be an area where 64-bit architecture helps.
So, 3-D games and any other vector graphics would benefit.

For integers and characters, the word size doesn't seem to matter to me.
I don't often program with integers beyond 32 bits (±2 billion signed,
or 0-4 billion unsigned), and even a one-to-four-byte Unicode character
fits in 32 bits. Yeah, streaming/copying characters can happen twice as
fast, but sorting on them would involve just as many steps.

Dual-core, on the other hand, ought to display some noticeable improvements.

So, what am I missing? What's the attraction of 64-bit? The ability to
use more than 4GB of RAM?

<hr><pre>I'm running a newer AMD 64 Bit processor which I believe has a 64 Bit data
path.

IMHO

Address space, memory access speed and register size for better floating
point accuracy are all enhanced by 64 Bit.  Math and graphics will benefit
but things like disk speed or network speed would be limited by other
factors.  Faster front side bus, larger processor cache and clock speed make
up much of the difference in speed from one machine to another that you can
see.  Some compute bound applications will see a bigger improvement from 64
Bit.  Perceived speed has so many components that its difficult to
quantify.  Many components change at the same time from processor to
processor making it difficult to quantify which components effected
throughput by how much.  Faster and bigger tend to be better.  That's the
most quantifying one can be without running bench marks that are indicative
but rarely applicable to how you use a computer.  The biggest impact of 64
Bit is that intuitively faster and us geeks love faster.

<hr><pre>When I was running a 64bit OS. The only noticeable speed increase was
during long compiles.  Large compile compiled noticeably faster when
running in 64bit mode.  However continuing to have to switch back and
forth between the chrooted 32bit environment led me to switch back to
a 32bit OS, Just easier.  I didn't notice enough speed improvements to
juststify the pain.
