<hr><pre>Hi All,

I was thinking of switching my work phone to the treo 650
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8185">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8185</a>

Can anybody give me their opinion on this? If I do order it, what type
of accessories should I get? What Carriers have you guys been happy
with?

&gt;From the above article, I gather that it works well with linux, and
Kpilot, so the integration looks like it might work well. I'm not so
sure how fast the internet access would be using the phone, but this
looks like it might work well.

Thanks for the IO

Welcome to the Club. Get it!

I've been running jpilot when I do synch, which I don't do often enough. I
don't have a SD card yet so I'm not sure about how it synchs with stuff on
there. I'll defer to Drew on that.

I'm on Cingular and have been decently happy. I do wish the phone was a bit
louder. But with an earpiece, it's just fine. I've used the speaker phone on
occasion and it was decent. (Nothing even comes close to the clarity of my old
Moto i1000 on Nextel.) I just have a cheap earbud that came with my phone. My
phone was a refurb unit through Cingular.

As far as cases, I run a Rhinoskin. Picked it up at CompUSA for about $30,
IIRC. It's lived through some decent drops and smacks. But the door has a
tendancy to catch and pop open, especially entering and exiting vehicles. So I
usually take it off first. The belt clip portion is the week link. Mine has
worn out pretty good in 4 months. :( And watch the screw-in piece on the back
of the case. Make sure to check it. I used a quarter to tighten it (has a
round-type of slot for such things) and it't been great.

It does a few things I find goofy. The screen will stay on FOREVER when you
hang-up from a call, but shuts off too quickly when using Blazer (web
browser).

As far as Internet access, Cingular has a $20 unlimited plan, that's not
listed when you look at the Treo, and it's supporting services. But they'll
show the metered plans, which you'll bust after about 5 mins. on any normal
site. I check the weather radar on my phone when it's raining, and that's
about 70kB a shot!

Program called Card Export II. will turn your phone into a removable USB
drive.  Mount it like a standard usb device under linux to copy files to and
from your card. Nice for working with windows ME/2k/XP systems too. No
drivers needed.

There are several programs to adjust the volume.  Alot of the limits are
limited in the firmware. (God help us if someone sues because they get ear
damage from loud cell phones).  Out of Box the sprint is the loudest, Then
cigular/verison, then tmobile.  But you can get 10-15 programs to get around
this and set it to YOUR desired volumes, not what the provider thinks it
should be.  The highest rated (and most expensive) is Voumecare 5 pro.  Lets
you increase volume by 250%.  I personaly did not need this on my phone, as
it was loud enought, but my boss and a client both got it, and are very
happy.  They both have cingular phones tho.



As far as cases, I run a Rhinoskin. Picked it up at CompUSA for about $30,

I went back to the leather slip case.  Still looking for a good
alternative.  I didn't like the Rhino,  I dunno if I got a bunk one, but
after mine became more epoxy then aluminium from minor repairs I junked it.
I still have 2-3 of the clips, brand new.  which I will probably never use.
If your intersted Patrick.

It does a few things I find goofy. The screen will stay on FOREVER when you
&gt; hang-up from a call, but shuts off too quickly when using Blazer (web
&gt; browser).



This was a big concern of mine.  Pissed me off that the screen remained on
durring a call, (keyboard too)  eating away my battery life.  This was fixed
with three things.  The first one, was a firmware update from sprint that
allowed you to turn screen off durring calls. But from my understanding the
other carriers havn't releaed an update.  Hence a program called &quot;Butler&quot;
This program is an all around neato addition to the treo. IT adds 6 quick
alarms, custom ringtones, autoscreen locks,  Fixing the backlick problems.
It also adds a feature where you can SMS your phone if stolen with a keyword
and it will nuke the contents, of both phone and memory stick, in
background.  Second program is call KBlights.  This program gives you
greater control over the keyboard backlight.  I HATED turning my treo on in
a dark room.  Keyboard would cause my eyes to cower behind my brain stem.
KBlights gives you control over when, how bright,, etc.  Now I have my
keyboard come on ONLY when it expects keyboard input.  I can toggle it by
tapping my side button twice quickly tho, for when I WANT to use my keyboard
as a search light.



As far as Internet access, Cingular has a $20 unlimited plan, that's not
&gt; listed when you look at the Treo, and it's supporting services. But
&gt; they'll
&gt; show the metered plans, which you'll bust after about 5 mins. on any

&gt; about 70kB a shot!
&gt;
&gt; Patrick
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
IF you get sprint make sure you go into a store. And order it with the
&quot;Vision Premium Pack&quot; Otherwise they will try and sell you a buissness data
plan for 500% more.  EXACT same thing.  Vision adds like $20, then throw $5
for unlimited text messages, you will get unlimited internet, and texts.  If
you get the unlimited buisiness plan, it';s liek 89$ extra a month.


Checkout www.palmgear.com  and www.treocentral.com  good places. Here is a
list of applications I keep installed on phone.

Zlauncher *  - OS/SHell replacement - Makes treo look pretty, and also lets
you run applications OFF your memory card. That 28mb internal ram gets used
up quick


Trips * - Milage and Client billing Tracker - (probably not usefull to you)

Palm Express $ - Realtime INformation database Generate maps, dirving
directions. yellow pages, news, stocks etc $6 a month. Worth it if you drive
alot to new places

Mobie Office * - MS Office Clone, and document management system. ROCKS.
Read/writes MS doc formats nativly, or the more compressed palm versions.

Turbo Password * - Password safe, Keep track of all your/clients passwords.
Database is encrypted similar to kwallet (tho not directly compatable, you
can import/export cvs tho)


Beyond Contacts * - Outlook Replacement. Great Great calandar replacemnt if
you use outbreak or outbreak compatable calander (which I'm stuck using)


Mobi Pocket reader * - Ebook Reader

PalmPDF * - Palm PDF reader (the adobe one sucks ass)

Tibr Pro *- NICE ebook reader

Student Toolkit * - Math and science info, Peridic table unit convertion.,
Electronic diagrams (Cederquist would love this one)

Backup Man * - Ghost for palm, shedualed backups, restore (saved my ass a
few times)

Butler * - Treo tools, enhancements, (great program)

Card Export II * - Turns palm into a USB harddrive. OS sees it as hardware
usb drive, no special drivers needed

Filez * - NICE File manager (although the one built into zlaucher is getting
very close to comparing)

HandZip - Winzip for palm

Kblight - Enhancements for lighted keyboard. Battery saver

PTunes * - Mp3/Ogg player Does shoutcast and streaming mp3/ogg formats as
well.

Mvnc * - Older VNC viewer

PalmVnc * - Newer VNC viewer (will not view older)

PDANet * - Lets you use your palm as a modem, very fast over USB, also
supports much better bluetooth management. This does require windows. Not
linux compatable. you MUST use internal bluetooth for linux. If you use
windows this is much better optimized for speed.  I keep a copy of the
client on my sd card. So I can run card export and install client on any
machine I need to.

Pssh * - Version 2 SSH client

Whois * - NS lookup info

Mahjong * - Yes i'm a nerd

Alchemy * - fun game

GBulator $ - Does GB and GB color emulator. 2000+ games in 300mb of card
space. ;)

NesEM * - Original NEs emulator

Gizmo Ultra - Sega and game gear, master master II, mark III system emulator

Kronos - Z engine games, Like Zork

VIdeo Jigsaw - Fun

Solataire - Days of wasted fun.


Tho out of all these apps if I had to pick 3.  Would be Zlauncher, Backup
Man, and Pssh

This is the plan I'm chosing from Verizon
Extra Choicesm
1,350 Anytime Voice Minutes
Unlimited IN Calling (mobile to mobile)
Unlimited Night &amp; Weekend Minutes
Unlimited Data Allowance(1xRTT)
$109.99/mo.
$0.35/each additional min.

I don't think I'll have a problem with the Bandwidth issue and pricing.

Thanks for the input Pat :-)

It was set to my server's internal name as it's behind the firewall. Mutt
picks up $HOSTNAME. So you have to set a custom my_headr (or whatever the

&gt; &gt; It was set to my server's internal name as it's behind the firewall.

Mike,

I just got the Treo 650 from Verizon, and I must say I'm happy with
it. I'm thinking of going with this case [0] - I had one for an ipaq a
while ago, and I must say I was happy to see they make one for a treo
as well :-)

Cheers,

~ stevo

Ask for Steve at the Verizon Store Right by Blackstone and Shaw. He
sold me one just the other day. I'm happy to report it works with

According to many threads, the 650 may not be edvo capable. A couple of
sources indicate that a firmware upgrade may provide the ability, but it's
not for certain.

Wow... :-O

That seriously rocks socks.... I read this review
<a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?page=3085&amp;head=45">http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?page=3085&amp;head=45</a>

and it looks like it actually works. Though I doubt I'm going to buy it
until the price comes down :-P
