This last week, a Slashdot post asked about securing
important documents in case of an emergency like
Katrina on a USB thumbdrives. Ironically, someone
commented, why not just send OCR'd PDFs of them to
your Gmail account? OpenOffice already has save as
PDF, a searchable Google drive would blow away the
WinFS idea. It'll be great to see what is produced.

Microsoft Office 12's Radical New Look
<a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/000900.html">http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/000900.html</a>

The author, Harry McCracken writes, &quot;OpenOffice.org
will suddenly sport the 'old' interface. The same
holds true for WordPerfect, which has lately been
following a 'We're a lot like Microsoft Office, only
more affordable' strategy. That's not necessarily a
knock on those products--actually, it might turn out
to be a major point in their favor, since they'll
presumably still sport the look and feel which the
world is familiar with, while Office 12 will be an
unknown quantity.&quot;

That's a huge user base.

This is *not* a new idea at all.  The idea of ASP (application service

actually done anything about it.

  I suspect they'll do something similar for an office suite, perhaps with the
  ads targetted to the content of your document.

  I really, really, REALLY am not looking forward to ads targetted towards the
  content of what I write about ... anyone advertising shit targetted at MY

  Little Mendle, loathesome tyke,
  Put Crazy Glue on sister's bike,
  She peddled all through Spain and France,
  Welded to her spandex pants.

  Burma Shave

  I mean, really, what sort of ads are you going to get with that?
  Proctologists? Do-it-yourself goatse.cx kits? 

All kidding aside, this boils down to a trust issue to me.  I'm not going to
demonize google.  I would imagine that they're some pretty decent folks.  I
just don't see many companies that are competing in a business environment
will be trusting enough to offload their storage to google and hope that
there's no &quot;accidental&quot; leakage of information.

Does anyone else have paranoia about this?

Great points. I know that *I* don't trust them. But then again, we had an
engineering company copy our work. I actually was tasked with writing up a
report to my supervisor looking for the similarities in the drawings. The
chain of events went like this:

Our DWGs --&gt; Project Architect --&gt; Other Engineer --&gt; Project #2 Plan Check
--&gt; Project #2 Backcheck Item List --&gt; Architect --&gt; Us

The developer sent us the plans for Project #2.

Subsequent communications:

Us --&gt; Our Company Attorney --&gt; Other Engineer --&gt; $10K check --&gt; Us --&gt; Bonus
$ --&gt; Me.

I don't trust anyone, anymore.

Now, some versions of software are &quot;free&quot; with advertisments. And they

Besdies if I was running productivity software, I wouldn't necessarily
want to use a google, or sun server, but install the app on a local

<hr><pre>It seems to me there is no such thing as a 100% solution. Gmail for example
has worked well for me because access is universal from home, work, PDA or
wherever I am. I also use thunderbird. As to important data, I go nowhere
without a memory stick and other than gmail store no data on any computer I
don't own and control. Use the tools that work for you and ignore those that
don't -- e.g. anything from or on Microsoft.

LOL.  I'm mellowing in my old age.  Still hopefull that you don't hate me for
the argument.  I do so love our chats.  I yawned due to the fact that this was
the &quot;next big thing&quot; 5 years ago and Billgatus was pontificating on the death
of the ISP in favor of the ASP.  Was he entirely wrong?  No.  Do I think that
ISPs will die in favor of mega corp domination of the physical infrastructure?
It looks like it's going that way.  Will ASPs be the new competition front?

enough to safeguard their data.

Specifically that they shouldn't be able to tap into your other usage of the
computer to target ads at you.  The fact that this could be done quite simply
without the knowledge of most folks is a difficult trinket to resist.
Especially given google's proven ability with data mining.  Couple that with a
nice bauble - say a nice productivity suite for free and some disk storage -
and people will overlook the EULA that says their privacy isn't theirs
anymore.

&quot;Um, no, your Honor.  I was just trying to find out what thermite was because
a friend of mine had mentioned it.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Oh.  *His* name?  Well... um... why?&quot;

&lt;/bring the kids back out&gt;

Anyone else thinking McCarthyism?

&gt; Besdies if I was running productivity software, I wouldn't necessarily
&gt; want to use a google, or sun server, but install the app on a local
&gt; web server so my information isn't exposed to the public net. Or at
&gt; least much less exposure anyway.

I think this is better done with any number of corporate solutions, a la
Novell Zen for Desktops.  The cost is not bad when compared to manual
installation on several machines (I don't actually know what the &quot;break even&quot;
point would be, but imagine it can't be much more than about 10) and the
feature set extends across your enterprise and not just to a single
application (or suite of applications).

Besides that, how does google/sun make *any* money by allowing you to run the
server hosting/serving the data and applications?  

The last time I looked at the ASP business model, they leased you applications
that you used and then had to lease again for the next &quot;time period&quot; based on
your usage requirement.  The thought being that you always get the newest
release of the software and only pay as you need the software (M$ was betting
that nobody could live without Orifice).  The two problems I see with this
format are: 1) the assumption of high speed bandwidth for the &quot;entire&quot;
installed base of the M$ Orifice suite, and; 2) the belief that people are
willing to wade through the upgrade process *more* frequently than they do now
for incremental increases in functionality.

For point one, there is definitely a better business case today than five
years ago, but the SOHO space is still fluctuating between hi-speed and dialup
internet.  As for the home user, dial-up is still the big winner just from the
infrastructure standpoint.

On two, if you're not using broadband, are you going to wait for the download
each time there's a bug fix/enhancement to the code?  What if you're paying
line charges as a business?  Do you want to upgrade everytime the feature set
changes?

<hr><pre>ASP sound like something a CFO can be sold on but he'll be sorry later.
Those of you that can remember time sharing on dumb terminals should be able
to figure out where ASPs will end up. Robert makes very good points about
security but I believe that user displeasure and associated whining will
send ASP to where all bad ideas go. There are no 100% solutions. ASP &quot;might&quot;
benefit lazy IT departments that have no sense of customer/user service. It
all may make open source a winner because the they grew accustomed to lower
upfront costs.

&gt; LOL.  I'm mellowing in my old age.  Still hopefull that you don't hate me for

&gt; the &quot;next big thing&quot; 5 years ago and Billgatus was pontificating on the death
&gt; of the ISP in favor of the ASP.  Was he entirely wrong?  No.  Do I think that
&gt; ISPs will die in favor of mega corp domination of the physical infrastructure?
&gt; It looks like it's going that way.  Will ASPs be the new competition front?
&gt; Only if you have tank-loads of money and can convince folks you're trustworthy
&gt; enough to safeguard their data.

Now I feel old...cause I &quot;remember when&quot; the whole ASP thing started...I think
that was back when I used to actually do stuff in ASP. ;) (Why yes, I've seen
the light now.)

You're still going to need an ISP in there somewhere. Unless they bundle
access. Do you then use their browser through your browser? Of course some
would love that as they could more easily force content filtering to block
access to what THEY don't like.

Personally, I don't trust anyone to safeguard my data. It's mine, and I'm
responsible for it's safekeeping. What happens if your beloved ASP decides to
close up shop in the middle of the night. Or they have financial problems and
their ISP cuts them off. I can see the armed rebellion forming outside the
doors.

&gt; Specifically that they shouldn't be able to tap into your other usage of the
&gt; computer to target ads at you.  The fact that this could be done quite simply
&gt; without the knowledge of most folks is a difficult trinket to resist.
&gt; Especially given google's proven ability with data mining.  Couple that with a
&gt; nice bauble - say a nice productivity suite for free and some disk storage -
&gt; and people will overlook the EULA that says their privacy isn't theirs
&gt; anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;entering the dark scary mind of FR - please hide the kids&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Um, no, your Honor.  I was just trying to find out what thermite was because
&gt; a friend of mine had mentioned it.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Oh.  *His* name?  Well... um... why?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/bring the kids back out&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else thinking McCarthyism?

What's wrong with a little research? Sheesh. Once found something in our old
encyclopedias: 70% potasium nitrate (saltpeter) 20% charcoal and 10% sulfer.
Or something like that... Just don't ever throw any sugar on it. LOL

&gt; I think this is better done with any number of corporate solutions, a la
&gt; Novell Zen for Desktops.  The cost is not bad when compared to manual
&gt; installation on several machines (I don't actually know what the &quot;break even&quot;
&gt; point would be, but imagine it can't be much more than about 10) and the
&gt; feature set extends across your enterprise and not just to a single
&gt; application (or suite of applications).
&gt; 
&gt; Besides that, how does google/sun make *any* money by allowing you to run the
&gt; server hosting/serving the data and applications?  
&gt; 
&gt; The last time I looked at the ASP business model, they leased you applications
&gt; that you used and then had to lease again for the next &quot;time period&quot; based on
&gt; your usage requirement.  The thought being that you always get the newest
&gt; release of the software and only pay as you need the software (M$ was betting
&gt; that nobody could live without Orifice).  The two problems I see with this
&gt; format are: 1) the assumption of high speed bandwidth for the &quot;entire&quot;
&gt; installed base of the M$ Orifice suite, and; 2) the belief that people are
&gt; willing to wade through the upgrade process *more* frequently than they do now
&gt; for incremental increases in functionality.

This is already kind of here. We use Autodesk software at work and were
required for one package to buy a yearly subscription, or they wouldn't even
sell us the upgrade. Now 1-2x a year I get a new version of 2 software
packages. By the time you get used to one package, they upgrade it on you.

They actually do an ASP type of thing where you can rent Autodesk products for
a short time. I could see where that would work well if you would have times
of the year where you bring in temp draftsmen.

&gt; 
&gt; For point one, there is definitely a better business case today than five
&gt; years ago, but the SOHO space is still fluctuating between hi-speed and dialup
&gt; internet.  As for the home user, dial-up is still the big winner just from the

Interesting point in the light of the current VOIP pissing matches taking
place.  Yes, but will there be any choice of ISP, or will it just be the one
or two &quot;blessed&quot; mega carriers ('cuz the Bell breakup is going so well now,

One wonders if the Bell's (or whatever they become when all the merging dust

That's easy.  They release final activation codes for the existing software
and, if you're not upgrading regularly enough to get them before they roll up
the sidewalk, you're done.  Otherwise, you've survived into free software!

There is no &quot;instant upgrade&quot; when you renew your $400 annual contract fee
(yeah, we do the autodesk bit at work too - they spam the crap out of us too).

That's a valid use for such a thing.  It's unfortunately a fringe case for all

That's a completely valid point. I'm pretty well happy with my ADSL line
through SBC. Though, we've had the account since it was PacBell (pre-Prodigy
merger/whateverthatwas) so using the information on their site is a lost
cause. Have to dig up the outgoing SMTP servers in the old pacbell.net site.
Tech Support CAN be a PITA. Lucky to understand them most of the time. Speed
is pretty good.

We've about come full circle now with SBC looking to gobble up AT&amp;T. They've
already bought AT&amp;T Wireless (well, Cingular did, but that's SBC's wireless
division.)

On that note, anyone know if they are out of DSL ports at Chestnut/Tulare? New
tenant in our complex at work went wireless as SBC told them nope.

FCC, DOJ, other TLA government agencies. This is the era of big business. If
you have revenues in excess of a $1B you get access. If you're an average joe,
you're p!ssed on and told to go be a good little consumer.

&gt; &quot;It's my loc-nar b----, give it back!&quot; [1]
 
Sorry, obscure references to 80s movies/cartoons are lost on me. LOL Though,
somehow, I might have actually seen it.

Hmmm. That's nice and altruistic. We're thinking about corporations. I'd doubt
it, but you never know. Wouldn't do much for &quot;shareholder value&quot; and due
dilligence.

&gt; Yes, but black powder is still rather socially acceptible in this country
&gt; (please, no anti or pro gun nuts on this thread) and something as unknown as
&gt; thermite can only be used for evil purposes. [2]

I'm sure the neighbors would have LOVED to have known what we were doing. How
we didn't get caught I don't know...filled a garage with smoke...

&gt; Yes, but they send you the disks with the &quot;option&quot; of upgrading if you choose.
&gt; There is no &quot;instant upgrade&quot; when you renew your $400 annual contract fee

True. I'm still running on 2004 at the office. I think we got 2006 in this
summer. It's bad when your application is actually larger than Fedora Core 4.
Or roughly the same size (1 DVD or 4 CDs.)

True. I think a full seat is 3500-4K. We use Building Systems with a full-seat
cost of nearly $5K. Architectural Desktop is a little less I think. BS is the
required subscription product. We are currently paying like $695 for BS and
$595 for ADT a year.

They used to do a 3 year or so release cycle. Now it's yearly. That equates to
about a $2100 update price on the old software. Of course back then, AutoCAD
ran about $2500 a full seat.

I've thought about investigating going down to a pure AutoCAD. Just doing our
own blocks. We really don't use much of the BS stuff, other then the blocks.
And we've already got those. The system isn't all the flexible or you can't
use it to it's full potential without investing a &quot;man year&quot; into configuring
the dang thing.

I've noticed a pro-gun stance in the open source community. I think it's a
Freedom thing.
