<hr><pre>I finally got Doteltech.com running EXACTALY the way I want it. BBS,
services, everything PERFECT.  At approx 8pm today (tues apr 25th) Server
took a major dive.  Harddrive failure on boot harddrive (boot loader and
OS). Server is located remotely so I have no access to it right now.  I will
attempt to fix it tommrow sometime.  Server does a Stage 4 backup to
secondary harddrive every night.  So I forsee little data loss or down time,
once I get in there to replace harddrive.  Bad news is anything dones AFTER
midnight the previous day is probably lost.  Good news is server and shells
will go from having a 10gb system drive, to a 160gb system drive.   No
worries, but if people are wondering where the BBS, Games, Webhosts and of
course shells went, don't be alarmed, they are all in suspended animation.

I do have to say. THANK GOD FOR TAR

restore a system that does what your system does if it were windows based.
That is the pain of windows.  Nothing is &quot;just a file&quot;  No system state
backup?  Reinstall then...

<hr><pre>Damn, I knew I forgot to set the &quot;fairy dust&quot;, and &quot;magic hardware&quot; USE
FLAGS in Gentoo. heheheh

See here is a PERFECT example of being a Quasi bad naught sys admin.  I have
a server (my own) running on a hard drive I KNOW is running on several years
of borrowed time.  I have replacement sitting on desk, and I keep telling
myself.  &quot;You know you can wait another week to replace that hard drive.
It's not THAT important right now&quot;.  On the flip side, I badger my clients
into replacing anything IMMEDIATELY if I have lost faith in the hardware.
Everyday I preach two things,  Preventative maintenance, and backups.  I
have to say at least I listened to myself on the backups.

To all users out there, New, old, seasoned, etc.   BACK UP YOUR
DATA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP.

Now you all might be saying. WOW this guy knows his stuff, he was prepared
he know how to quickly recover from data loss with minimal problems.  Well
I'm sad to say that THAT was a lesson I had to learn the difficult way too.
Fortunately it stuck the first time. SO I pass on some advice to thoes who
have not experience that gut sinking, bowel wrenching, teeth grinding, eye
budding and pant wetting experience of data/system/server loss.

THO IF YOU DO, I'm available for data recovery at a nominal $150 /hr.
*WINK*

    The first computer class I ever took, the instructor said, &quot;There are 2 
kinds of computer users - Those that *have* had a computer crash, and those 
that *will* have a computer crash.&quot;
    He pointed out that the media or the method you used (assuming it was 
fairly reliable) or whether you knew how to restore it, wasn't as important 
as whether you backed it up at all.

&gt;     The first computer class I ever took, the instructor said, &quot;There are
&gt; 2
&gt; kinds of computer users - Those that *have* had a computer crash, and
&gt; those
&gt; that *will* have a computer crash.&quot;
&gt;     He pointed out that the media or the method you used (assuming it was
&gt; fairly reliable) or whether you knew how to restore it, wasn't as
&gt; important
&gt; as whether you backed it up at all.

That's the awsome thing about backing up a linux box properly. You can
go from bare metal, to fully functional in 20 minutes or less. Depending
on if the tar matches the architecture of the machine you're restoring
too (made that mistake once)

<hr><pre>I know most of you probably know how to properly back up a linux system, but
for us windows admins who are just told to purchase software that does it
all for you (veritas backup exec, arcserve, whatever), but when you start
talking about using tar for anything other than extracting, I really am at a
loss.  So, what software do you prefer, how do you use that software (backup
and restore strategy), and how often do you back up?  How would you use tar
to compress a file and then write that file to tape?  Too many questions not
enough time.  I guess my answer should probably be RTFM and slap myself
around until I do that, but I would like info on bare metal restores and DR
(Disaster Recovery) scenarios that others may use.
