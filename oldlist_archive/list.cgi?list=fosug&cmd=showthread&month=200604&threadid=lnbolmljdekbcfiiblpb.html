<hr><pre>You know, I tried out gentoo last year (or year before last.  Can't
remember) and while the speed for this OS was the best in Linux that I have
seen, the user experience during the install was the hardest of any linux
install in recent memory.  I guess the current installers in other distros
are making me lazy.

I have to really give the Gentoo crowd credit however.  That have taken 95
percent of that pain away.  The liveCD installer made everything point and
click (including compile options).  My only remaining problems came after
install when I realized that selecting xsession and xdm were not the right
choices for a display manager and login screen.  Luckily I had a laptop here
and was able to find the way you change that via command line and nano.

If you are a longtime Gentoo User and have not used the livecd install, I
recommend you boot off of the cd and check it out.  Its pretty nice.

My only remaining issues are to set the graphical bootup to a higher
resolution (the section where devices are loading is currently at 800x600 or
640x480.  This on a 19 inch monitor)  and then to figure out how to add
mozilla and other new applications into grub's menu after emerging them in.

It's nice, I do like being able to walk away, I like the fact you can save
the log and redo same install later. (with text based gui at least)

Yes once you get to know gentoo ahead of time you would know the correct
answers for there, but as you are learning, you don't have the experience
prehand.  Even with a GUI install I still would not push gentoo at the
begining linux user. Granted it's extreamly powerfull, but in the wrong
hands it's very much like giving a baby a 2000HP Trike.

&gt;
&gt;
Bootup is limited to 1024x768 due to limitations in VESA. These can be
adjusted with boot parms and framebuffer support.  However Framebuffer
support can bring up new problems on some hardware (specificaly cheap video
cards and/or laptops).

Grubs menu?  Do you mean Gnome?  Grub is your boot loader.

<hr><pre>&quot;Grubs menu?  Do you mean Gnome?  Grub is your boot loader.&quot;

Sorry, yes, meant Gnome.  That problem fixed itself on reboot.   I am
guessing that gnome just needed to be refreshed by logging out and logging
back in but I was working on a SATA boot issue where it wouldn't boot my
windows XP partition.  Had to map hd0 to hd1 and switch it back in grub's
menu.lst file.

Yes once you get to know gentoo ahead of time you would know the correct
answers for there, but as you are learning, you don't have the experience
prehand.  Even with a GUI install I still would not push gentoo at the
begining linux user.

Well, I wouldn't push gentoo at a n00b either, but I have banged around with
SuSE just enough to give me the confidence to take another shot at Gentoo.
Another 5 shots anyway.  I tried to load it in a vm and that just wasn't
happening.  Something happened with VMWare and the network connection would
die out after a while, and kill part of the install, thereby choking it.  I
did the install on my old desktop here at home and things work just fine.
Plus somebody named Drew walked me through a manual install when I tried it
the first time and things worked out ok, until I tried to recompile a kernel
on my own and fubar'd things.  So, I had some of those settings in my head
and RTFM (Gentoo Handbook) helped a lot.

I need to change the boot parameters to get to that 1024x768 resolution.  I
am looking for an answer now while emerging stuff in.
