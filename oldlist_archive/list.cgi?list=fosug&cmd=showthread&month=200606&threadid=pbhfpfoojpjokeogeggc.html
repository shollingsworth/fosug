<hr><pre>After finding out that I wouldn't be in the right financial place to
buy a new laptop anytime soon, I decided last weekend that I wanted my
celeron 766 based laptop to be just a bit snapier.  I've been running
debian stable on it for about 18 months, and while I am a huge debian
fan, running gnome on the thing (with only 192 megs of ram) was just a
bit to slow for my taste.  So I bit the bullet and pulled down the
install disk for gentoo 2006.0 and spent the weeking doing a stage 3
install.

I really must confess that I'm extreemly impressed with the speed
gains I've been able to achieve.  I don't have any hard numbers, and I
still haven't compiled all the applications I want/need (because it
takes a long damn time to compile some of them) but the system is
noticibly more responsive.

Overall, I really like it.  I do have some complaints about speed,
mostly just frustration at how long it takes to emerge new
applications of any size.  I realize that's the trade off for a faster
system, and I'm mostly fine with it.  However, does it really need to
take so freaking long to sync the portage tree?  Also, it dosen't feel
quite as integrated as several of the other desktop distros out there
(Ubuntu comes to mind), but then again, neither did Debian really.  I
am a little frightened however, that when it comes time to upgrade the
system that I will be down for another weekend of compiles.

I still plan on using Ubuntu on my primary workstation, and debian is
still my choice for a server OS on decent hardware as there simply is
nothing out there that beats it for the combination of stability and
package management. (apt in my not so humble opinion is just supurb),
but I do have a much more healthy respect for Gentoo, and I look
forward to getting more familiar with it.

Regards,
-Chad

<hr><pre>congrats man,  For the major large applications there are sometimes
binary version available in the portage.  for huge applications like
open office I usually choose binary.  I mean who cares if you save 10
cpu cycles on your spell check. ;)


I know there has been talk about revamping portage with a differnt
database type.  The portage worked well when there were a few thousand
applications in portage.  But now there are MANY MANY M ore then that.
and indexing takes too long, even on horribly powerfull machines with
fast harddrives. you can quasi cheat on a desktop by adding it to your
cron at night. still takes for-freakin-ever but who cares, your
dreaming of ipods and racecars.

<hr><pre>I've been in a love hate relationship much like you with my Gentoo experience
so far. The system feels much snappier over Fedora Core 3. I'm running 2006.0,
though I'm behind on updates. The thing about Gentoo, is there is no massive
versioning updates. You just run the updates as you go and it's current.

I'll probably stick with a RH based distro for work as I know it better, and I
can't really take the downtown to build the system from the ground up. I
basically have over a weekend to upgrade the system. (New RAID gear is coming,
so that will be happening in the next few weeks.)

If I was able to take the time with all new hardware to install and get
everything running, I would probably try it. I like the non-version thing.
Just keep the updates coming. Best way I can equate it, is like driving down a
highway. There's all kinds of onramps along the highway. Doesn't matter where
you got on the highway, you're still at Mile X.

I can't wait at some point to do some video work. I was running about 8:1
encoding from DV (Sony D8 source) to MPEG-2 DVD Spec. That's 8 hours for every
one hour of video. Granted, that one that I timed it on, was some horribly
jumpy video (Jeep run in the mountains.) It was constant motion and compressed
horribly. (On the other hand, making stills pics into video compresses
wonderfully...I calculated out on what I had done so far to about 8hrs of
video at 5 sec/image @ NTSC resolution.)

The worst to compile was KDE. I actually started it in a screen sessions one
night, or maybe it was morning, then went out of town for work. It was nice to
be able to log back in and check the status. Took about 36 hrs.

Oh yes, OpenOffice-bin and Firefox-bin here. 

Exactly how fast is 10 cycles with say a 3GHz machine? Is it even noticible?

What are you using for your video?  I'm thinking about building my next 
computer around the specs required to run Cinelerra 
<a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3">(http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3</a> and <a href="http://cvs.cinelerra.org/)">http://cvs.cinelerra.org/)</a>

I've just started to really get into video and this looks kinda fun.

I haven't done much just a couple of tapes (a Jeep trip, some ATV stuff, and
the rest was photo album stuff). I used Kino. Tried to use Cinelerra. HOwever,
I looked at the interface and had no idea where to start. LOL

As far as source, I have a Sony DCR-TRV 460. It's Digital 8. So the quality is
between Hi8 and MDV.

The specs for Cinelerra are pretty intense. Last I looked was a Dual Opteron
with a couple GB of RAM. Wish I had the kinda money that would take to build
something. :D

I use a combination of dvgrab and kino to make my movies.

Speaking of which, I haven't had a chance to update the website, but
