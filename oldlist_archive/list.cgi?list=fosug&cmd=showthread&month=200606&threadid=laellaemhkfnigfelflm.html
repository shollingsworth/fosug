<hr><pre>got a few questiosn for you.  I have a samba PDC setup. Originaly
setup to use roaming profiles. However few found that half the
building is still runining on 10base/T.  I've looked to disable the
roaming profiles on google. But It seams that they keep taking place.

I want to remove roaming profiles, but still be able to run login
scripts.  Got any ideas?

You need to make the variables empty like so:

logon path =
logon home =

Funny you should mention this because I ran into the same problem
recently.

Windows Domains + Laptops = Yuck!

I had a hard time figuring out how to have the laptop guys share the
same profile with the domain. I guess there isn't any real way of doing
this. The domain credential caching maxes out at 50 and default to 10
for logins. I ended up just going for a workgroup setting

Anyway, the above lines in smb.conf will do what you need.

Hope this helps.

Stevo's answer is correct but leaves out an important caveat of converting
back from roaming profiles. [0]

Any of the desktop settings that existed in the roaming profile will now go
away.

This isn't always a terrible thing but is definitely something that I wish I
would've known.

[0] Yes, I too left roaming profiles because I had users storing several
megabytes of data on their desktop.  This can slow the login down a bit.  Even
over 100TX-FD.

Ahh yes. Me too, but still have romaing profiles active. Two words: My Pictures.

Two users with about 4-5GB each. It's now on their desktop, outside of their
profile. They lose it, it's not my responsibility, and they know it. One user
took about 10-15 min on a bad day to log on.

The desktop is stored in the profile also :)

You can right-click on the My Docs folder you can put My Docs on a
network share.  If your only supporting a few computers then you can
just setup the redirect My Docs for each of your users.  The setting
will be applied to their profile so it will roam with them.

If your on an AD domain then you can also make a GPO that redirects the
desktop folder, My documents, Start Menu, etc all to network shares.  I
just checked on some profiles sizes at work and they all look to be
about 6-10MB and the majority of this size comes from the Application
Data folder.  If I felt really ambitious I could also redirect the
Application Data folder to a network share.

I have My Docs redirected. But it still syncs them. You can log on to the
machine when the server is down and have everything still there. I'm going to
rebuild the server in the next month or so. Hopefully I can get all the little
things that bite me in the but fixed. Originally I had Win 2K and 98 machines
logging on to the domain (Samba PDC). Now it's only 2K &amp; XP.

98 and 2K behave differently so I had to have a funky setup.

&gt; 

Alas I'm not using AD. hopefully someone else will find that helpful.
