<hr><pre>I have a Linksys EtherFast II 10/100 Managed 24-Port GigaSwitch that I'm 
trying to connect to via the consol port so I can set an IP address and 
try to find out how to set up stuff like vlans etc.  I've tried 
connecting to it with my windows computer using hyperterminal but all I 
get is a blank window.  Since I've seen this happen with more then one 
windows based pc, I'm trying to connect with my one of my linux 
computers, but I'm unsure where to start.  I've never had to use a 
serial connection using Linux before.

Can someone point me to some howto's or something to get me pointed in 
the right direction?  I've googled it, but all I'm finding are howtos on 
how to set up a linux server to allow consol sessions to connect to it 
via serial ports...

I've set it up according to the manual, but I'll try your suggestion. 
Here's what the manual says:

Local Console Management
You can manage the GigaSwitch locally by connecting the switch to a PC 
or workstation with terminal emulation software using the serial port. 
Before you log on to the GigaSwitch, make sure that the switch’s serial 
port settings are as follows:
BAUD RATE: 115200
FLOW: None
PARITY: None
STOP BITS: 1
DATA BITS: 8
EMULATION: ANSI
CURSOR EMULATION: VT100

I read the manual...
<a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1115416834345&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1115416834345&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper</a>

OK, I hate to ask... but did you plug the  switch into a network with
a dhcp server?

do an nmap scan, or check your dhcp log for anything that gives an odd
&quot;linksysish&quot; name or none at all.

try to plug into it on port <a href="http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx">http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</a>

give the username: blank
password: admin

see if that works.


PS: the documentation sucks for that switch LOL

ooops... unless we're talking about this one.
Sorry... I ASS(U)MED too much in the previous post.

<a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1130276637958&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1130276637958&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper</a>

The DHCP thing still remains... you just have to look up the default
password which with linksys is &quot;admin&quot;

Cheers,

Yeah, tried that too, even reset the switch.  using nmap doing a scan on 
my whole network I still can't find anything that's not already know 
about...  The switch part of it works fine though.

I'll check my dhcp logs though.

<hr><pre>You could hook up one of your Linux boxes as the network with a DCHP
server.  That way you'll know what the network is doing.  When all else
fails -- eliminate and isolate.

Just my two cents -- George

I've done countless network scans with nmap, and I've been sniffing my 
traffic with Ethereal, EtherApe (just cause I like that one... lol) and 
Ntop and none of these show anything other then what's shown above.

But enough for tonight.  I'm off to bed.  Thanks for all the input from 
everyone.

*nod*

Minicom rocks.  It's the de-facto standard for linux comms.

As for how I would address your problem, I wouldn't futz with the serial cable
at all.  Connect a machine to that box and nothing else.  Get the mac address
for the switch off the bottom of the box (it should be down there somewhere,
yes?) and then do an arp -s [0] for the mac address of the switch to set the ip to
something on the same subnet as the machine you plugged into it (you'll have
to setup a fixed address on the computer with the default gateway either empty
or set to the ip you set on the computer).

HTH,
--Robert

[0]  Assuming that the mac address of the switch is 11:22:33:44:55:66, the ip
of your computer is 192.168.1.1/24, 'arp -s 11:22:33:44:55:66 192.168.1.2'.

&gt;Minicom rocks.  It's the de-facto standard for linux comms.
&gt;
&gt;As for how I would address your problem, I wouldn't futz with the serial cable
&gt;at all.  Connect a machine to that box and nothing else.  Get the mac address
&gt;for the switch off the bottom of the box (it should be down there somewhere,
&gt;yes?) and then do an arp -s [0] for the mac address of the switch to set the ip to
&gt;something on the same subnet as the machine you plugged into it (you'll have
&gt;to setup a fixed address on the computer with the default gateway either empty
&gt;or set to the ip you set on the computer).
&gt;
&gt;HTH,
&gt;--Robert
&gt;
&gt;[0]  Assuming that the mac address of the switch is 11:22:33:44:55:66, the ip
&gt;of your computer is 192.168.1.1/24, 'arp -s 11:22:33:44:55:66 192.168.1.2'.
&gt;  
&gt;
I've come to the conclusion that this part of my switch may be 
defective.  I've tried the arp approach from both a Linux and Windows 
computer, plus I've even brought home an old win98 laptop to try 
connecting via serial cable all with no joy.

Under Windows: arp -s 192.168.1.10 00-04-5A-80-13-DF (00-04-5A-80-13-DF 
being the MAC Address of the switch) still gets me no where.  I can't 
ping it, I can't access through a web browser and I can't telnet to it 
by the IP Address of 192.168.1.10 which I tried to assign it with the 
above command.

 I've tried resetting the router several times and as far as installing 
the factory firmware, you can't do that unless you can access the router 
by network.  I've tried connecting to the Serial interface from 4 
different computers now, all with no joy as well.

Thank you, everyone, for your input and help.  I guess this nut just 
isn't going to crack :(   Maybe my boss wont mind if I mess around with 
our nice new Foundry switches at work... lol

Lately, I've had not the best luck with the arp -s method with some
pieces of gear, like some Aironet radios we have at work.  However,
firmware upgrades which give the ability to clear passwords really work
well.

Though does the manual say whether it has a default IP address as
shipped?  If so, you might go that route (no pun intended).  Granted,
that would apply more to routers than to managed switches.

Anyway, those are a couple of ideas I had.  But if it's new, warranties
are Very Good Things(R).

<hr><pre>Don't assume that all telecommunications equipment has properly implemented
Internet standards.  Cisco is famous for creating their own &quot;standards.&quot;  I
used to build network access equipment and we had to have configuration
parameters that worked with cisco or everyone else's routers.  Many devices
with telnet access only support one session.  My favorite is Motorola.
Their cell site radios have two Ethernet ports for redundancy of management
connections.  Their configuration gives both ports the same IP address.  I
had to build a hub with a failure switch to allow connection of both
management port to the Internet.
