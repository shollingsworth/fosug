 The meeting for may the first is LINSPIRE Operating System
[image: Computing the Way it Should Be...]

364 E. Barstow Avenue
Fresno, CA
Fresno and Barstow

I will personally be there, might be an interesting meeting.  Feel free to
come. You won't be the only linux junky there.  I'll see what linspire is up
to this year.  Plus I'll be willing to answer any questions people have
outside the standard meeting.

Ronnie, do you think they would mind if I brought some fosug flyer's for
those that are interested?  I don't want to step on any the the toes of our
PC brethren.

I too plan on being there unless I turn stupid and forget in the next 10
hours. (Yes, it happens.)

    You know, I really don't know what the Emily Post is on this kind of 
thing. Bring some fliers - I'll try to get there a little early, and I'll 
ask Bill Myers (long time friend and FPCUG Prez) if it's OK.

Less than spectacular. Linspire stood them up with an email in the afternoon.
As Sanjiv said, they had a canned presentation from MS they showed. To call it
a lackluster presentation would put it mildly. The biggest reason for that is
the presenter really had no idea what to do. So I don't fault him. Imagine
someone tossing his presentation (which he happened to divide up into multiple
PowerPoint/Impress/etc files) and tell you to go for it. And oh yeah, you
really didn't even know anything about what you were presenting.

I'm not sure, but I think Ronnie was about ready to fall asleep.

The highlight for us FOSUGers was when Drew jumps up with his laptop and runs
outside before the Linspire boot/login noises filled the auditorium.

We did field, well, moreso of Chad and Drew, questions on Firefox and
Thunderbird.

<hr><pre>For me it was pretty interesting.  Quite a different group of folks
than at a FOSUG meeting.  Most of the attendees interests seemed to be
more application centric ie. more interested in working with
applications than knowing how/why they work.  I guess less technically
centered.

I did speak one on one with a couple of the folks there, and all of
the people I meet were very nice.  Other than that, I spent most of
the night watching Drew argue with the gremlins in his USB cable.

&gt; So how did the meeting go last night? :-)

I noticed that they say on the site first Monday of the month, but
says the 10th is meetign date. Is this correct, because today is the
2nd?  Assuming it was moved because of 4th July?
