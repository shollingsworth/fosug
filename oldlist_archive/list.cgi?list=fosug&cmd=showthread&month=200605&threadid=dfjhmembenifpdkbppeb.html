If you're keeping up, what do you think?

<hr><pre>I read this on the 8th.  It would seem that Microsoft has learned from their
lawyers -- &quot;Lie they have to prove it.&quot;  Actually, the more lies they tell
-- the more likely they will be caught.  A soap box in Fresno is of little
use.  The local audience has no desire to listen or only speaks Spanish.  I
do my part with every person I help with technology by solving their
problems with open source even if I have to run that open source on Windows
(retching at the thought).  One convert at a time.

PS -- If anyone is interested, I have SuSE 10.1 up and running with Nvidia

dragging on.  The process is very tedious and I would think most that try
would fail or just give up.  I bought a PVR card which requires the ivtv
driver.  For now I also have my bttv card so I can watch TV.

<hr><pre>Hey George,

Are you running all whizbang XGL + compiz goodness as well? I'm
currently running Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper) and enabled it a couple weeks
ago.  The effects are REALLY DAMN COOL, though I do confess that since
I don't really utilize multiple desktops, I can't find a lot of
practical use for it, except for scale and the new switcher, which I
use regularly.  I do experience some high CPU utiliztion from time to
time, but no other glaring 'beta sotware' bugs.

For those of you who haven't seen the compiz demo video, there is a
link to it in the compiz wikipedia article:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz</a>
Direct video link:
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi">http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi</a>

And for those with a fast connection and an ATI or nVidia 3d video
card that's not more than a couple years old, try downloading the
Kororaa live cd.  It includes all the cool features, and dosen't
require to futz with your system.  Find it at:
<a href="http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=static060318-181203#download">http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=static060318-181203#download</a>

<hr><pre>Yes I have it running on an nvidia card on my amd64. (no chance of running
it on my laptop)  It's very nice, and love the effects. Just don't run
anything java, or BOOM your back at a console.  It's still a bit away
production level.  Has some problems with widescreens.  IT does take a alot
of cpu utilization. So for the time being i've god back to xorg. BUt fun
eyecandy. I give it 2 more years before it's a standard worth using.

&gt; If you're keeping up, what do you think?

I think it's typical Microsoft BS. They should come out with a new
product called MS-BS &quot;We say we give you more, but not really&quot;. MS being
two faced isn't a big suprise, they want to look like they're doing
what's right in the media, but when push comes to shove they always do
what they do best, make money.

&gt; If not, why?  Do you think this will make itself happen? [0]
&gt; 
&gt; --Robert

I'm hoping that Microsoft will comply with the Openoffice standards, but
I doubt that will happen due to the fact they always go proprietary to
make it as hard as possible for their customers to switch to another
product. The only way I see them starting to fall into compliance with a
standard is if not doing so would somehow decrease revenue.
