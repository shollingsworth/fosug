Hello all,

I found out about your group through a friend that talks wildly about everyone 
here. I look forward to interesting talks about Linux and FOSS.

My name is Nathan. I've been using linux for almost 13 years... in some form 
or another. The first computer I got had DOS on it and I didn't know what to 
do. A friend of mine told me to download something called slakware. I 
downloaded about 14 floppies, then went to town. Since I didn't know anything 
about DOS, had no programs for it, basically no clue what I was doing... 
slakware fit perfectly! 
Nowadays we have more than 8 character file names so we can properly refer to 
it as Slackware. I installed it and never looked back. I've been doing some 
form of administration or development work with Linux ever since, but in the 
last 5 years I've found myself being forced to support Windows... (ugh)

A friend and I started a Linux user group in our small town, and that is 
taking a lot of our time. We are getting ready to start advertising in our 
local paper to get people to come to the library for our first meeting. I 
can't wait!

I've been a longtime slacker, but recently I discovered ArchLinux and have 
really enjoyed playing with it. Currently, all my systems run one version of 
slack or another, but my laptop (main machine) is running ArchLinux 0.7

I look forward to conversing with everyone and celebrating our favorite free 
software!

Thank you for taking the time to create this group. Though I don't live 
anywhere near Fresno, UG's are important. And yours comes highly recommended.

Nathan

Thanks for the praise! There are a lot of great guys in the group.
Maybe you can drop by sometime if you're in the area and attend one of
the meetings.

Nice to meet you Nathan :-) I'm glad you decided to join the list, the
more the merrier I say, and I'm sure a lot of the guys would agree.
Robert Nickel is the only guy I know in the group who has been doing
this for 10+ years, he's kind of like Yoda to most of the guys here
(hehe).

One you get the site up let us know, we can post a link on our page as
a sister site.
