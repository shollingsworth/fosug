<hr><pre>Dear All,

    On the plus side: Mike, I successfully accessed the hosts file and specifically named my main computer according to IP address. From there I'm able to access my Apache web server's home page from the computers on my network. &lt;little happy dance!&gt;

    On the not-so-plus side: I'm trying to install Ubuntu Linux on a secondary computer. I thought that the Ubuntu download was bootable. Either it isn't, or I did something to mess it up when I burned the disk - or something else is going on. 
    I set the computer to boot from CD ROM, and I'm getting the message:

&quot;Boot from ATAPI CD ROM

Required system component is not installed&quot;

    If anyone has insights here, let me know. I can't use the Knoppix distribution that I have, because it's a DVD, and this computer doesn't have a DVD drive, only a CD drive.

I'll throw out the usual question in this circumstance.

Did you burn the file as in image, or a file. In other words, if you put it in
a running system, do you see a bunch of files, or do you just see a
something_or_other.iso?

    Yes, I've got the something_or_other.iso. Should I have something 
different?

&gt;&gt;you can get a program (free trial) thats very
easy to burn ISO's  called ultraiso&lt;&lt;

    FWIW, I used NTI DVD Maker 7. I downloaded the file 
ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso, I used the &quot;copy&quot; option, I think. I have 
blurry memories of discussions on a forum or eleven that discussed very 
specific ways of burning the disc and the options necessary to do so. The 
operative word is &quot;blurry&quot;.

<hr><pre>Hi Ronnie,

Basicly, you can think of an ISO as type of zip (though without the
compression) file.  It contains the image of all the files needed to
boot an run the live cd.  In order to turn the iso into a bootable
disk (instead of a cd with one .iso file), you need to select the
appropriate option in your burning software.  For example, using Roxio
version 6 (and version 5 if memory serves) you select File | 'Record
disk from image' and then select the .iso image you wish to burn.
This will 'unzip' all the files in the .iso to the disk, and make it
bootable.

If you are unable to find this option in your cd-burning software, or
your version of the software doesn't support it (some of the 'light'
software versions are crippled in some fashion), then there are, as
Drew mentioned, utilities that you can download to handle this.  If
that doesn't work, please feel free to let me know, and I'd be happy
to run a copy of Ubuntu over to you.

By the way, the most current version of Ubuntu (6.06 LTS) was released
overnight, so you might want to download the newest ISO.  I've been
running beta versions of this release for over a month now, and in my
opinion it is an excelent piece of software.  My system actually runs
faster using version 6 than it did using version 5.

Sorry to drone on so long....
Regards,
-Chad

<hr><pre>Chad,

    Please continue to drone on. &lt;g&gt; Your explanation was very helpful. It 
made several things much clearer, and that's very valuable. I'm wading into 
several concepts I haven't dealt with before, so the background stuff is 
good.
    I'm gonna download the lastest, and give this another shot or two, but 
if I can't get it to work, I'll take you up on your offer of the disk.
    Thanks muchly.

Back when I ran XP at home, I found a little add-in utility that integrates
into Explorer that allows you to burn ISOs. Wish I could remember the name.
Bascially you right click on an ISO and &quot;Burn&quot; etc. Whatever it was.
