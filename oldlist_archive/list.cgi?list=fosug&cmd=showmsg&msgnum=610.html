&gt; Interesting point in the light of the current VOIP pissing matches taking

&gt; right?) that you are required to get &quot;service&quot; through?

That's a completely valid point. I'm pretty well happy with my ADSL line
through SBC. Though, we've had the account since it was PacBell (pre-Prodigy
merger/whateverthatwas) so using the information on their site is a lost
cause. Have to dig up the outgoing SMTP servers in the old pacbell.net site.
Tech Support CAN be a PITA. Lucky to understand them most of the time. Speed
is pretty good.

We've about come full circle now with SBC looking to gobble up AT&amp;T. They've
already bought AT&amp;T Wireless (well, Cingular did, but that's SBC's wireless
division.)

On that note, anyone know if they are out of DSL ports at Chestnut/Tulare? New
tenant in our complex at work went wireless as SBC told them nope. 

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;donning tin-foil&gt;
&gt; One wonders if the Bell's (or whatever they become when all the merging dust
&gt; settles - would someone like to loan the FCC a spine?) will be allowed to
&gt; enter into the ASP market and be both ISP and ASP and, if so, when M$ will
&gt; move into the carrier business.
&gt; &lt;/donning tin-foil&gt;
 
FCC, DOJ, other TLA government agencies. This is the era of big business. If
you have revenues in excess of a $1B you get access. If you're an average joe,
you're p!ssed on and told to go be a good little consumer.

&gt; &quot;It's my loc-nar b----, give it back!&quot; [1]
 
Sorry, obscure references to 80s movies/cartoons are lost on me. LOL Though,
somehow, I might have actually seen it.

&gt; That's easy.  They release final activation codes for the existing software
&gt; and, if you're not upgrading regularly enough to get them before they roll up
&gt; the sidewalk, you're done.  Otherwise, you've survived into free software!

Hmmm. That's nice and altruistic. We're thinking about corporations. I'd doubt
it, but you never know. Wouldn't do much for &quot;shareholder value&quot; and due
dilligence.

&gt; Yes, but black powder is still rather socially acceptible in this country
&gt; (please, no anti or pro gun nuts on this thread) and something as unknown as
&gt; thermite can only be used for evil purposes. [2]

I'm sure the neighbors would have LOVED to have known what we were doing. How
we didn't get caught I don't know...filled a garage with smoke...

&gt; Yes, but they send you the disks with the &quot;option&quot; of upgrading if you choose.
&gt; There is no &quot;instant upgrade&quot; when you renew your $400 annual contract fee
&gt; (yeah, we do the autodesk bit at work too - they spam the crap out of us too).

True. I'm still running on 2004 at the office. I think we got 2006 in this
summer. It's bad when your application is actually larger than Fedora Core 4.
Or roughly the same size (1 DVD or 4 CDs.)
 
&gt; That's a valid use for such a thing.  It's unfortunately a fringe case for all
&gt; I can tell and definitely *not* something I would bet money on for &lt;$400 a
&gt; copy software.  ACad retails for ~$3k these days, yes?  That's a far site more
&gt; than just about any office suite I'm familiar with.
&gt; 
&gt; --Robert

True. I think a full seat is 3500-4K. We use Building Systems with a full-seat
cost of nearly $5K. Architectural Desktop is a little less I think. BS is the
required subscription product. We are currently paying like $695 for BS and
$595 for ADT a year.

They used to do a 3 year or so release cycle. Now it's yearly. That equates to
about a $2100 update price on the old software. Of course back then, AutoCAD
ran about $2500 a full seat.

I've thought about investigating going down to a pure AutoCAD. Just doing our
own blocks. We really don't use much of the BS stuff, other then the blocks.
And we've already got those. The system isn't all the flexible or you can't
use it to it's full potential without investing a &quot;man year&quot; into configuring
the dang thing.

&gt; 
&gt; ==============================================================================
&gt; [1] Sorry here.  Bad reference to an 80's movie.  A cartoon, no less.
&gt; [2] &lt;rant&gt; Yes, I'm pro-gun.  &quot;Gun's don't kill people, I do.&quot;  Especially
&gt;     when I get told how well anti-gun laws work abroad. &lt;/rant&gt;

I've noticed a pro-gun stance in the open source community. I think it's a
Freedom thing.
