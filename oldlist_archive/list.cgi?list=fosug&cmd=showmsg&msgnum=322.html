Yeah.  It's still up.  Here's the text (man I love vim! Sorry for the long
post for those who could find it):

  Windows vs Linux
  A review by Cody &quot;EEDOK&quot; Hollis-Perdue April 1, 2005
  _________________________________________________________________

  Well I was pressing my curiosity when I decided it was time to try something
  new. Hearing Linux in the media alot and all the buzz around it, I decided to
  give it a try. There was my first mistake, there was more &quot;flavors&quot; of linux
  than you can shake a stick at. I asked a computer savvy friend of mine which
  was best, and he smiled and said OpenBSD so I decided that would be the one
  I'd try. OpenBSD is known as the most secure OS out there, and here's my
  experience with it compared to Windows.  

  Acquisition:
  Well to get OpenBSD I had to go to the site and choose between so many
  disks. In the end I decided on the 3.6 iso, then I had to burn it on to a
  cd, the whole time I felt like a criminal.  Windows on the other hand was
  much less painful, as there was only 2 to choose from. I chose smartly and
  took the professional edition and just paid the cashier $400 for it. Nothing
  to it really.

  Winner: Windows

  Installation:
  I'll start with Windows. To put windows on your computer it's not too hard.
  What the windows install entails is hitting enter, wiping out all your data,
  selling your soul, hitting next real fast, entering the serial number,
  failing, leaving you wondering what you did wrong and why you have to
  restart it, going through all the steps again 5-6 times, and taking about 3
  hours of your time.  
  
  If OpenBSD had a title screen before the install it'd be much like OpenBSD
  3.6: Welcome to Hell on Earth(footnote 1), the installation lures you into
  thinking all is going well until it hits you with OpenBSD's most reliable
  security method: dumb sysadmin prevention application. How it works is the
  OpenBSD's install is so hard you need to be genius to have a chance to
  complete it, thus eliminating the cause of the majority of security
  issues(dumb sysadmins), and I must say it works rather well. Back to the
  install it's pretty simple just hitting enter until you run into fdisk. What
  is fdisk you ask? Well first it seems like a tool that may let you preserve
  some data on your hard drive and have an operating system run beside another
  one. The truth is it's a hell spawned minion out to ravage your brain, and
  cause general mayhem. Once through the complete hell of fdisk, you think the
  madness is over, but no, next comes the devil himself known as disklabel, to
  wreak havoc even more on your poor brain. disklabel serves no purpose other
  than to confuse the hell out of you and to cause installs to fail(although
  it does give a reason for failure unlike windows), after disklabel,
  thankfully the rest of the install can mostly be done by hitting enter lots.

  Winner: Windows

  First Boot:
  The windows first boot is setting up things like networking, automatic
  updates and such, which is all just a ploy to send all your information to
  microsoft(shown through the activation step), and then ends with an
  appealing desktop environment, designed by blind children(god bless
  Microsoft for allowing childrens work into their product).

  The OpenBSD first boot is a cold black and white command line, with no
  support for a mouse or windows.(Apparently you can obtain an archaic desktop
  by using what's called X to gain window and mouse support).

  Winner: Windows

  Bootup Speed:
  OpenBSD boots up really quickly, so fast I can't get up and grab a coffee
  while my computer is loading, windows loads slow enough to do this, and I
  like my coffee.

  Winner: Windows

  Included Programs:
  Web browser:
  OpenBSD comes with a text based browser called lynx, which is limited in
  functionality. Windows comes with internet explorer. Face it Internet
  Explorer is hunk of crap.

  Winner: OpenBSD

  Text Editor:
  Windows comes with notepad, a great easy to use text editor, for limited
  sized text files. OpenBSD comes with vi, another hell spawn which causes
  mayhem, and kills kittens every time a user attempts to use it. Using vi is
  about as pleasant as a trip to the dentist, for three root canals, without
  anesthetics. Another feature of the end of the stupid sysadmin is forcing
  the user to use vi to actually get the user to have the system do something
  that could be potentially insecure.

  Winner: Windows

  Graphics Editing:
  Windows comes with paint, the almighty graphic editors of the graphics gods
  and goddesses, enough said.
  
  Winner: Windows
  
  Multimedia:
  Windows has Windows Movie Maker, Windows Sound recorder, Windows media
  player and quite possibly a lot more. OpenBSD has ???? and ???? isn't very
  functional at doing anything.
  
  Winner: Windows
  
  Games:
  Windows comes with top quality games, such as solitaire and minesweeper,
  whereas OpenBSD comes with things like fortune, banner and hack, too hard to
  decide :/
  
  Winner: no winner here
  
  Uptime:
  Well my windows stays on until I go to bed, when I shut it off. My OpenBSD
  stays on for days and days on end, cause I can't figure out how to turn the
  damn thing off!!!
  
  Winner: OpenBSD
   
  Overall:
  As it's clearly evident here based on my extreme testing on this 1 install
  of OpenBSD I can say without any doubts, Linux is not ready for the desktop.
  Maybe if it tried some blush or other cosmetics it may do better.  Everyone
  should know that Windows is the only real operating system out there(as all
  others are just fakers) and will be the only one to gain acceptance from
  anyone. If only Internet Explorer went through the same quality control as
  the other programs like paint and solitaire did.

  footnote 1: sorry bout not having the gimp/photochop of the doom 2 box
  modified to suit this, kinda ran out of time.
