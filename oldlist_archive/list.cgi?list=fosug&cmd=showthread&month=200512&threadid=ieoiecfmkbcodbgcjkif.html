<hr><pre>It's that time of the month again (don't think sick you sickos). The time to
feed the hungry penguin in all of us. Chowmeign, lemon chicken, potstickers,
and  sugary twisty bowties. Or maybe some pork ribs, tritip sandwiches, or
all you can eat pizza at johns increadible pizza.  What we feed the penguin
does not matter, the point is that we feed the penguin, we feed him well.
and we feed him in the presence of happy laughing friends. Beer sometimes is
a major component in penguin feeding.

So the decisions, When, Where, Who, and how sloshed can we get Mike C. so he
will pick up the tabs.

Weeeeeeell, since you asked. I wanted to tell the
board that I regret missing the dinners, since my new
job means working nights Monday through Thursday.
Realizing that I had accidentally replied with an
empty message, I figured FOSUG wouldn't miss me
anyway. Apparently, my assumption was uninformed and
the group values my presence. So, why don't we move
the dinner into the weekend as well?

It is great.

I originally heard about Usenix from Jerry Carter when I went to the Atlanta
Linux Show in Oakland in 2000 (or was that 2001?).  I bought him dinner and he
spilled his guts.  :-)

The rest is history.

&gt; Are we doing a fosug mtg this month?

I don't believe so.  It's the silly month.
