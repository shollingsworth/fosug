I'm open to anything except Korean food, had a bad experience with
kimchi LOL. Wherever you guys want to meet is fine by me.

I have it on my calendar for the 26th @ 7:30pm, I figure we should move
the time up a bit.

The best thing about Shakies was the awesome thunderstorm outside. We could
have dipped the pizza in the gutter water and it would have made it taste
better. ;)

JIP? errrr....nah.

Applebee's sounds good. And so does Hometown.

I'm with you on Doghouse. It rocks, but not a great place for a meeting type
of thing. Or any conversing.
