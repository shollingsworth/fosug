<hr><pre>Hello,

I know this isn't exactly &quot;local&quot; but it is within driving distance.
And I did mention it in passing about a month ago.

Some info about a technical conference coming up.

What is the USENIX Annual Technical Conference?
In a nut shell, it's 5 days of training, 4 days of Birds of a Feather
meetings(what Herschel been pushing), and 3 days of technical talks
(and there a whole slew of other events) of almost everything under
the sun Unix wise. Please take a look of the schedule to get an idea:
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/ataglance.html">http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/ataglance.html</a>

When is the USENIX Annual Technical Conference?
April 10â€“15, 2005

Where the USENIX Annual Technical Conference?
Marriott Anaheim, next to the Anaheim Convention Center.

Why YOU should Attend?
Not only will you get a first rate training course(if you decide to
attend a training course), and get to hear the latest developments in
the Technical tracks, and also a chance to interact w/ your peers
doing the same things you are doing, but imho, the biggest reasons to
attend is you get a chance to meet some of the greatest luminaries in
Unix history. A very partial list of people(in order of who I
remember, so no order at all) I have meet at past Usenix Conferences,
Eric Allaman of Sendmail fame, Ted Tso of Linux fame, Kirk McKusick of
BSD fame, Gerald Carter of Samba fame, Rob Pike of many different
areas, Bill Joy of vi (and other) fame. If you look at the program,
most of these people are listed as coming already.

If you take a look at the Guru is in Sessions:
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/tech/gurus.html">http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/tech/gurus.html</a>
This alone justifies the conference price. Imagine, a place where you
could ask a lead developer a question on how to make something work.
your own personal consultant.

What this email is about?
If we are able to get at least five people together, we could get a
group, under UUASC, discount rate of $100 off registration. If we
could get more then 20 people together, the Usenix folks said they
would talk to us about a larger discount.

What to do?
If you are planning on going to Usenix, and would like to be part of
the UUASC group, please email me and I'll include you in the list. If
you are thinking of going, or might be interested w/ a larger
discount, email me and indicate so in your email.

How will it work?
When I get a list of all of the people interested, I'll forward the
list to Usenix (on Monday morning) to get a &quot;Priority code&quot;. Then I'll
forward the Priority code to everyone who is going(and interested in a
larger discount if we could get it). You will then have to register
yourself at the website:
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/registration/">http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/registration/</a>
make sure you register by the end of the day of Monday, march 21 to
also get the early bird discount. According to the website, you could
register now, and pay later(don't know how long later is).


So please, anybody interested, please email me to let me know.
Steve

ps. please forward this email to any interested parties.

You didn't mention Mad Dog!  He's almost always to be found hosting the linux
kernel BoF with Ted.

What's with you man??  ;-)

I cannot go as another of my coworkers is attending (only fair since I just
went to LISA).  However, I will give a resounding &quot;what he said&quot; to the rest
of this.  The best sysadmin training available, hands down.

I don't actually remember(doesn't mean it didn't happen) him hosting
any linux kenel BoF's at a usenix event. I do remember him introducing
Linus(and ted and a bunch of other people) at various other things. I
don't even know if they are going to have a linux kernel BoF this
year, or even if Linus will be there or not.
 
&gt; What's with you man??  ;-)

You know, the usual, ate lead paint, dropped on my head, just wasn't
right, what kids do.

Thanks for endorsing what I said, and sorry you can't make it.
