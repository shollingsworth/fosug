<hr><pre>*Dramatic Soap Opera Music*

Well this is mostly venting and a little bit of bitching on my part.  

Last night spend the night late into the evening recovering data from
a downed server. (nice pay but too many hours) Ended up talking to
India again about active directory. Now many people know I'm a fairly
adept computer person. But I'll be honest. Active directory and
Windows Domain servers for some reason really kick my butt.

In the situation of a nice ass whooping I'll bow out of the picture
and call for help. Granted it's nice being able to call MS and get
some fairly intelligent people on the phone to help (sometimes you get
booger eating morons) Assuming of course you can understand a single
word that they say.  Why India is my question.  Anyways I degrees. Got
what I needed off the server, not for the job of repairing it. Well
it's almost 1am so I'm going to bed, hell with server tonight. MS rep
tell me they will have someone on next shift call me for the morning
around 10ish.

At about 6:30am I get a call on my cell phone with entirely too many
digits in the caller id, I think something like 75 numbers (or at
least to my sleepy eyes). I answer it. It is the Microsoft rep that
was assigned to my case. Evidently he was bored and decided to get on
his call backs early. (Props to Him, rather he get on it early then
waiting till end of shift where he has to toss me to another person
starting process ALL OVER AGAIN) 630am is not a time of the morning
that my mind functions. So here I am talking to some guy in India in
my maroon boxer shorts and sleep in my eyes. Well he has some ideas to
get the Second Domain controller working again.  Hell I'm up, and have
full capabilities to log on remotely. So I work with this guy for
several hours. He is convinced the problem is in the Primary Domain
controller and not the secondary.  My gut says secondary, but I'm not
the one with the MCSE. I don't know the solution to the problem,
that's why I'm calling, so I'm not going to argue. We work on the
Primary controller for a few hours. AT this time I need to remote into
my actual work, let them know I'm working with a client remotely and
not to be shocked if I don't show up. Remember I'm still in my boxers,
haven't' showered or anything. I can't remote in, so I try to email my
work, can't do that either. Phone is down too. The Term WTF comes to
mine a few times. So I send a text message to a coworker.  MS guy says
he has to do some &quot;research on problem&quot; and call me back.

Shower time, pack up may laptop and take off to work.  No power.
Transformer exploded in the night. LOVELY. and of course UPS's died
and since phones are PBX they are down too. Once power comes back on,
my schedule calender looks like some giant Monmouth vomited on it. 
Several dozen &quot;emergency's&quot;.  Of course. Start digging into my vomit
and make a dent. Still waiting for MS to call back.  Around noon still
no call. Call MS and find my Rep left. Damn it well he just lost those
points he got for calling at 630am. Find out from his notes that he
found the problem was not with the primary domain controller and just
left it as &quot;solved&quot;

I think around now I scarfed some type of food substance down. 

Called MS again and had them reopen call. They told me to wait while
they shoot my call to the tech support. Back to India I assume.  A
young woman answers the phone. Her name is Gina.  No no offense
intended but I have NEVER dealt with a woman in high level tech
support ever before. She is speaking English with no accent. I can
actually understand her. Hell if she actually knows anything, I don't
have to have her repeat herself 20 times so I can understand her. So
YAY a positive point there. We start the whole problem process again.
(little irritated at this point, but it's not her fault so I'm patient
and explain it).  Give her the history on the server.  She asks if I
have the case number for the last problem. She reviews it and comments
that the last tech who worked on it from MS. Really missed the mark.
She logs in remotely and I shadow (watch) her work.  In about 15
minutes she bypasses the corruption in the second DC that kept failing
Active directory. She tells me this is not a fix for the second
controller but will bring the network back while she works on solving
the problem.  True enough Bang network is back. Granted running slower
and with a nice lag. But considering it had been down for 5 hours.
I'll take it. At this point she starts flying though the registry at a
speed that scared me. She was changing keys, deleting keys adding keys
at a speed that was faster then I've ever seen in my life. She
continued doing this for about 3 hours, explaining to me what she was
doing and why. Making me feel extremely inferior tech wise. After
about 3 hours. She tells me to reboot. I reboot and everything come up
working perfectly. File Replication, all services everything.  I about
lost it right there. The previous tech had to restart server 30-40
times and do &quot;research&quot; for every registry change, This woman went ape
crazy on the registry and took care of ALL the problems on the fly.
I've never seen anything like it. So evening was LONG but feel like
something got done at least.

Just get home. After dealing with a Microsoft server that just tried
to school me in the proper way to crash and cause general pandemonium.
(spelling?).  Sit down, start looking at forums, and turn on the music
nice and loud.  Nice. I smell something burning. My window is open, I
start looking for something burning. Can't find anything. I assume
it's something outside. Smell starts to get sharp like plastic and
electrical. So I get up to go outside and look for something bad. When
suddenly my beautiful LCD screen busts into flames. The fu**er
literally flamed up. Filled the room with smoke. I rip it out. Rip out
the power connector, then work on data connector. Not an easy feat to
remove a screw on connector while there are hot flames cumming out the
back of a monitor.  By the time I finally get the data cable off the
the LCD the flames are out. Minor damage to my desk and my right
speaker appears to have a new art deco shape to it. No major damage
cept for monitor that sold for around $700.  No damage to apartment,
My nerves are a little shot. Nice exciting day if you ask me. It's now
10:27pm in June. and the power is flickering on and off and it's
Raining. WHY IS IT RAINING IN JUNE!!!! All I gotta say is this day is
too long, and too damn weird.  I am glad the monitor decided to comite
suicide while I was sitting in front of it.   I am afraid what would
have happened if I was still stuck at the clients just 30 minutes
longer.

Oy, Well enough bitching.  Though some might be interested in my wild
day.  If not it's good therapy for me to type it out. Keeps me from
snapping and murdering people in Kmart.

That's what you get for buying from PC Club ;)  I think your way out

about her 'going crazy' in MY registry&gt;

Crappy day, but hey you're right about one thing, glad you were at
your desk, and that your entire apartment didn't go up in flames.  Two
words. Renters Insurance.

Hope Friday is loads better for you.
