<hr><pre>Hello FOSUG-ers,
I have been quietly lurking for about a month now - trying to figure  
out what the heck y'all are up to. Lots of different things!
I am a local web developer and a very active open-source user. I got  
pretty excited when I saw next month's topic - MySQL. YAY! Seems a  
good segue for the main reason I am delurking - I am in search of  
Drupal users, developers, themers, admins, and/or folks interested in  
learning about the technology.

For those of you unfamiliar with Drupal, it's an open source CMS  
built on php/MySQL.
<a href="http://drupal.org/">http://drupal.org/</a>

...and it's what i used to build
<a href="http://www.fresnofamous.com/">http://www.fresnofamous.com/</a>
and
<a href="http://www.modestofamous.com/">http://www.modestofamous.com/</a>
and
<a href="http://www.calcleanair.org/">http://www.calcleanair.org/</a>
plus a few more sites that are mid-development.

I'm also hoping to reach local web developers in general (aka actual  
coders). There's a big disconnect between us here and a ton of  
opportunities.
Looking forward to next month's presentation!

<hr><pre>Nice to see you here, Suzi!

I've been admiring your work on a number of community web sites, as well
as YOUR OWN... That little &quot;what we do&quot; animation on thinkinkless.com is
funny!

I'm a web developer myself - not much of a graphical designer but I work
with the &quot;back-end&quot; side of web applications or web sites, in PHP/MySQL
mostly. Been developing a web application for &quot;a long while&quot; now - the
online demo is coming any week now...

Drupal? I'm afraid I haven't used it, since I built my company web site
<a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://www.activeagenda.net)">(http://www.activeagenda.net)</a> with Mambo. Drupal is possibly more
extensible/flexible than Mambo/Joomla. However, the availability of
attractive, well-designed templates is very different: I couldn't find
almost any for Drupal, while there are plenty of useful and tweakable
templates for Mambo/Joomla.  Also, most Drupal sites that I have seen
seem to be kind of hard to navigate - as a user, it's easy to feel lost
or not realize what else there is to see on the site.

I'll try to make it to the next presentation.

<hr><pre>I'm happy to have received responses to my Drupal shout-out!
Thanks to all for making me feel welcome.
There are a couple things the list may find useful...

snips from Mattias Thorslund:

&gt; Drupal? I'm afraid I haven't used it, since I built my company web  
&gt; site
&gt; <a href="http://fosug.org/cgi-bin/(http://www.activeagenda.net)">(http://www.activeagenda.net)</a> with Mambo.

This is a really nice mambo site!

&gt; Drupal is possibly more
&gt; extensible/flexible than Mambo/Joomla.

Drupal is extremely scaleable - which is one of the primary reasons  
we chose it. We are able to run multiple community sites using a  
shared codebase. We also have a few shared tables for things like  
roles and permissions - as well as content types. This means we don't  
have to reinvent the wheel as we add communities. Most of the work is  
achieved at the theme level - core never has to be touched.

Is it me or is the contrib stuff for Mambo really scary? I have never  
used it but this is one of the reasons why we chose drupal over mambo/ 
joomla for fresnofamous.com. Drupal makes it totally clear which  
contrib modules are in full release vs CVS. I found most tools (plug- 
ins? drupal calls them modules) I was looking for were still in beta.

&gt; However, the availability of
&gt; attractive, well-designed templates is very different: I couldn't find
&gt; almost any for Drupal, while there are plenty of useful and tweakable
&gt; templates for Mambo/Joomla.
&gt; Also, most Drupal sites that I have seen
&gt; seem to be kind of hard to navigate - as a user, it's easy to feel  
&gt; lost
&gt; or not realize what else there is to see on the site.

Interesting! I think there will be a lot more themes available for  
the next release. FWIW It's reallyreally easy to code a custom theme  
for Drupal - or to alter an existing one. I usually start with  
bluemarine (phptemplate theme engine is a must) and tweak from there.  
Configuring navigation is the job of the site admin - and I agree it  
is not always done well on Drupal sites (true of many sites in  
general). This is part of the reason I customize themes pretty heavily.

&gt;&gt; Drupal is possibly more

&gt;
&gt; Drupal is extremely scaleable - which is one of the primary reasons  
&gt; we chose it. We are able to run multiple community sites using a  
&gt; shared codebase. We also have a few shared tables for things like  
&gt; roles and permissions - as well as content types. This means we don't 
&gt;  have to reinvent the wheel as we add communities. Most of the work 
&gt; is  achieved at the theme level - core never has to be touched.


This is the benefit of using a CMS rather than building a site from scratch,
besides the fact that people don't need to be programmers to add content to
their site. Likewise, I can set up multiple similar sites with Mambo and just
customize the themes differently, and maybe install a few different plugins.


&gt; Is it me or is the contrib stuff for Mambo really scary? I have never 
&gt;  used it but this is one of the reasons why we chose drupal over 
&gt; mambo/ joomla for fresnofamous.com. Drupal makes it totally clear 
&gt; which  contrib modules are in full release vs CVS. I found most tools 
&gt; (plug- ins? drupal calls them modules) I was looking for were still 
&gt; in beta.


There certainly is a LOT of contrib stuff for Mambo.  Much of it is good.  And
many of them are alpha or beta - I think it is wonderful that people are
upfront about the status. Many of them eventually graduate to &quot;stable&quot; 
quality,
depending on community involvement, feedback and contributions. Others fall by
the wayside, because they are superceded by something better or because 
there's
too little interest. I don't consider something that doesn't seem &quot;active&quot;.

There's also a whole cottage industry of for-fee plugins that do some really
fancy stuff.

What's scary about Mambo/Joomla in a way is how easy it is to install plugins
(there are specific terms for different kinds of plugins) - they can be
installed by uploading the zip file directly through the back-end web
interface. So if someone else is a Super Administrator, they might install all
kinds of hokey plug-ins that they might like (bells and whistles!!). Also,
web-based installs mean that the file permissions on the server must be set
permissively, allowing the web server to write to folders where it also
executes code - not a good security practice, at all, at all.


&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, the availability of
&gt;&gt; attractive, well-designed templates is very different: I couldn't find
&gt;&gt; almost any for Drupal, while there are plenty of useful and tweakable
&gt;&gt; templates for Mambo/Joomla.
&gt;&gt; Also, most Drupal sites that I have seen

&gt;  is not always done well on Drupal sites (true of many sites in  
&gt; general). This is part of the reason I customize themes pretty 
&gt; heavily.


There are plenty of free themes for Mambo/Joomla, but some really &quot;droolable&quot;
ones are found here: <a href="http://demo.rockettheme.com/">http://demo.rockettheme.com/</a>

Yes, I hope there will be more themes for Drupal, too. Actually, I'll 
be looking
at learning more about Drupal in the future, since I envision writing 
plugins to
interface with Active Agenda (letting employees report hazards or make
suggestions directly from the company web site for instance)...

Definitely feel free to ask me questions about Mambo, PHP, MySQL etc.

Have you used any AJAX-y functionality by the way?  Opinions on which toolkits
are easier to work with than others?

Best,

Mattias

I agree, that is a great looking site. I'm not much of a webdev myself,
but I sure want to learn some of this stuff, which is why I'm looking
forward to the presentation on MySQL.
