&gt; For those at the last meeting, we had a guest Mr. Adrian Rodriguez from The
&gt; Fresno Business Journal. I was please to get the copy today and to see that
&gt; the Open Source article was on the top of the first page! SWEET!
&gt; 
&gt; Adrian was kind enough to even put when we meet, but unfortuntely there was an
&gt; error saying we meet on 3rd Thursday. I did fire off an email to him for
&gt; correction. If you or your business gets the Journal, take a peak. It's
&gt; actually a pretty decent sized article. Loved it. Quote from FOSUG's own Mike
&gt; Cedarqust, Drew Baker and Suzi.
&gt; 
&gt; Patrick

Sweet, I wish we could see a copy online.

Anyhow, I've updated the website (if you guys can do a quick check on
content e-mail me offline and I'll fix it)

Sorry for last month and not updating the website, I know the site and
flyer updates drive attendance to the meetings.

The topic for the July meeting is the How to setup a presentation using
vnc2swf? If so who is presenting?

I'd like to get the site updated and flyers out a few weeks before the
meeting this time.

Thanks again everyone,

~ stevo

Well... If it were possible, I'd volunteer, but alas the miles keep me 
away.  lol  Since I told you all about this, I've been looking for any 
way of transforming flash .swf files to .avi format.  It would appear 
that ffmpeg has this ability, but my current setup seems to be lacking a 
codec or I need to recompile it to make it work correctly, as I've been 
quite unsuccessful.  Anyway, I can't wait to see the presentation once 
you have it on line.

Doesn't mean you can't create the presentation and send it. ;)

Hmm... Skype perhaps.  I'll tell you what.  I'll work on this, but given 
the two current events in my life right now* I can't guarantee that I'll 
be able to find time to finish it.  I'll try to show it on both Linux 
and Windows since I'm already using it at work to make video tutorials.

this week, I'm the only IT guy for my company...  Flying solo, I'll be 
supporting 140 users in 8 different states and 9 different branches.  If 
my days go like today did, I'm going to be pretty busy!
