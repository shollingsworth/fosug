<hr><pre>Dear All,

    On a completely new topic, my local enabler, Dennis, is looking into getting me a thumb drive. Neither of us know much about them, but he found a 80gb one that looks interesting:

<a href="http://tinyurl.com/fb299">http://tinyurl.com/fb299</a>

Is 80gb too much to ask for? Is a smaller drive a smarter choice? What about brand names? Is there some special feature that you find invaluable?

<hr><pre>Ronnie,

Think about what you want to use it for.  I find them very handy when they
are key fob size and don't require a cable.  That way you can carry it
everywhere and always have important data available.  They are great for
backing up what you're working on and making it easy to use more than one
computer -- say work and home.  The one I've used is only 256MB and it
serves me well.  If I purchased a new one today I might be inclined to get a
1GB unit.  Circuit City has a large selection so that you can peruse them in
person.

Have a great day -- George

I've got a Lexar Jump Drive Secure (even support Linux, however, I was never
able to get the modules to load right). I've got the 256MB model which is
plenty for me. I carry a few things on it (National Elec Code PDF, SSH keys).
Came in handy when I was working on someone computer to grab some files for
backup.

I'm not sure if they are supported, but don't see why they wouldn't work, 1GB
USB drives at OfficeMax for $20 before. Never got over there to pick one
up. And unlike their CF/SD/etc card sales, they had an entire bin of these
things (Clovis Store). It was a no-rebate thing as well. Sometimes they have
great deals, but you have to deal with the whole 50% rejection factor of
rebates.

<hr><pre>Note, to make a flash or jump, or thumb drive usable in linux. You
need 3 things compiled in your kernel. Either monolithic (all in 1
kernel) or in moduals.

USB Support
USB Mass storage
and
(whatever Filesystem your card is) In 99% of cases it's Fat16 (so you
would use vfat)

Once thoes are compiled and running, simply plug in device.  if you
check the dmesg log you will see it showup as a Scsi drive.  /dev/sda
for example. then you mount it like any normal drive

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/flash
or whatever they happen to be.


Second note. ALL USB Flash/Pen/Thumb/Jump/Toe drives are linux
compatable (unless they are a crappy knock off, and I havn't seen a
non-standard knock off in about 7 years).  Easiest way to verify if
you will have problems with your drive.  PLug it into any windows ME
or XP computer and if It detects without the need for drivers, it is a
standard MASS STORAGE USB device.  Virtualy every usb storage device
uses this, harddrives, flash, most digital cameras. etc

Drew I meant that the encryption application. It has a kernel module to enable
the encryption that's cross-platform. That's what I couldn't get to work.
Otherwise it works just peachy.

Good to know that all pen drives should just work. I even did the udev thing
of creating a device based on the serial number or whatever it was. Thanks
Stevo for giving that little demo a few months back.

Next time I see those pen drives maybe I'll pick one or 2 up. Was going to do
that for my mom. They only allow them to store stuff on ZIP disks at work. No
central storage for their stuff. Don't ask me, I don't know. Somehow they
justify the cost of ZIP drives and their insecurity (information kept on them
I would consider to be confidential data) as opposed to a file server. Not
sure if they lock down the machines USB. I'm assuming you would be able to
siable the USB Mass Storage with a policy.

This is NOT a thumb drive(at least not in the traditional sense). Most
people consider a thumb drive to have a USB interface(which this one
has) with flash memory(this one is a hard drive). This is more like a
external hard drive which gets it's power from USB(not really a good
idea for an external hard drive, imho).

If you want an external USB hard drive like this, you could build it
yourself (external USB hard drive enclosure($30) + 80 GB hd ($50)) for
much cheaper.

If the device is a laptop harddrive or even better yet a micro drive.
The power drain is minimal to run them.  I would not worry about
running them off a usb.  They will significantly reduce the battery
life on a laptop tho.  3.5 (full size) harddrives can ACTUALLY be
powered off usb. however they push it to it's limit.  Cheap hardware
might burnout.  So you will RARELY see a full size harddrive run off
usb. IF you have one. Get the external adaptor. or invest in a new
box. ($20-30 for nice external case).
