<hr><pre>Well it's officicialy Christmas. Presents, food, and more food, even more
food.  Hope everythign is going well.  I was hoping to have a box with a
million dollars and a powerbook, some harddrive, an xbox 360, stereo, and
lots of candy. hehe But then I woke up.  If anybody is looking for a gift,
i'll take a box of luck. Payed my final truck payment on 8am on Dec 24th.
The truck is official mine.  At aprox 8pm that evening while having dinner
at Chris's parents house. My (officialy paid off truck) got a brand new
present from one of the neighbors.  A Cadilac shaped passanger side. Woman
smashed into the side of my baby. :(.  Nobody was hurt, nobody was in the
truck, she was parked on the street.  Lucky for insurance I guess.  Maybe
I'll be able to get a nice new paint job out of it.  Anywho, I thought that
was a bit ironic and funny. (since nobody was actually hurt) Wanted to wish
everybody a happy &lt;insert holliday variable here&gt;.  Hope everybody is having
fun.  eating well, and dreaming of their Treos (patrick and stevo, Doit doit
doit)

Dude, that totally sucks monkey nu...errr...yeah. My buddy paid off their car,
and not as soon as you, but with a few months, his wife got rearended. Luckily
it was repairable.

And I did, it's just left to Stevo to get his. LOL. My Treo is sitting, I
guess, at the FedEx facility in Ft. Worth, TX. Should be here Wednesday. One
day I'll be picking up the Rhino Skin. Probably get a SD card as well, if
anyone will have any. I know Office Max had pretty much been whiped out.

Hopefully everyone is having, did have, or will have a great holiday.

Err, one should really verify stuff before they put it in headers. Just in
case anyone has looked, the URL in X-PGP-Key header was wrong. It's pmmay, not ppmmay
that was in there. DOH! I fixed it now.
