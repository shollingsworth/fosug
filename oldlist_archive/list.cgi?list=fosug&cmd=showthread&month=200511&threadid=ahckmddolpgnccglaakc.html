<hr><pre>Hey, there was a thread a while back on this mailing list about sbc blocking
port 25 on dynamic dsl accounts. Well, I just wanted to post a follow up to
that. At the bottom of this page here...
 <a href="http://support.sbcglobal.net/article.php?item=4640">http://support.sbcglobal.net/article.php?item=4640</a>
 There is a note that says this:
 -------START CUT--------
 To request removal of the filter, use the Abuse of Service form at
<a href="http://help.sbcglobal.net/servabuse.php">http://help.sbcglobal.net/servabuse.php</a> to contact our Abuse team and choose
the &quot;Opt-Out Port 25&quot; under *Abuse Type*. Enter your account Member ID (also
called your SBCIS PPPOE Login ID or User ID) to opt-out. If you have
multiple SBCIS accounts you want to opt-out, please submit a separate form
for each Member ID. *Do not* enter your email addresses from the other mail
hosting provider. You should expect that it will take SBCIS 12-24 hours to
process your request.

After receiving a confirmation email, sent to the SBCIS Member account ID
being opted-out, you will need to logoff the SBCIS network and turn off your
DSL router or modem for 1 minute to remove the filter. You should then turn
your modem and system back on and log in using the normal procedure
 -------END CUT-------
 So, you should be able to remove port 25 filtering period. I think all of
you are pretty good about getting around such things, but I wanted to put
this up on this thread in case somebody else wanted to know this. I am
putting this into play on my dynamic dsl clients.

<hr><pre>Yes we do use this all the time. Unfortunatly about 70% of the time they
either don't do it. OR do something completly different. I had to spend 30
minutes explaining to SBC that &quot;Opt-Out&quot; ment we did NOT want it. Versus
that we did want it. Very frustrating. Unfortunatly that web page is not an
automated script that takes care of the problem. All it does is send an
email to the standard SBC level 1 tech support. and you have to hope it gets
taken care of correctly by whoever gets the email.

I was the one who posted that. I just set Postfix to relay through SBC's
servers (that in and of itself was a PITA, as I'm an old PacBell.net account
and my mail relay (and setup for mail, etc. is diff. that the support pages
list.)

A lot of ISPs won't allow incoming mail from dynamic IPs as well. So it's best
to relay through the ISP.

But the carnage is the best part. Evil attack penguins come in quite
handy at times :-P

You have microsoft RPC exploits flying every which way, NTLM passwords
splattered against the wall, IIS parts hanged on hooks for any
unfortunate soul to see. It's quite grusome I assure you.

Ooops... halloween is over isn't it? My bad. I'll refrain from furthur
evil attack penguin comments.

Drews attack penguin is quite nice. He just has a problem with
extensions that end in DLL,EXE,CAB,VBS,COM,BAT, just to name a few.
It's like a matador with a red cape. No good can come of it :-P
