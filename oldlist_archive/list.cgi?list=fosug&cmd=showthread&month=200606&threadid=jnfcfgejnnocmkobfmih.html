<hr><pre>You know that OpenOffice.org Impress can export your presentations or 
power points as a flash movie (.swf file).
Also, you can use VNCRec to record your presentation directly from your 
desktop.  (VNCRec <a href="http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec).">http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec).</a>  I also use 
vnc2swf at work to create training presentations.
(vnc2swf <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/)">http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/)</a>

With vnc2swf, you can import audio into it as well with command line 
tools.  Using Audacity you can capture the audio of the presentation and 
later dub it into the flash video.

Here's a good write up <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/102/washko.html">http://linuxgazette.net/102/washko.html</a>

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know, I've been thinking about how we do the presentations.  Maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt; we should just record the video directly from laptop and lay over
&gt;&gt;&gt; audio.  forget using camera to record slides and person talking
&gt;&gt;&gt;       
&gt;&gt; Pat: you using dvgrab and kino to pipe the video to raw mpeg?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Drew: I've tried doing what you stated above and it didn't work out so
&gt;&gt; well for me. Do you have any tutorials on how to do that?

&gt;&gt;     
&gt;
&gt; I've got the video grabbed (dvgrab). That was the easy part. I loaded them up
&gt; in Kino to just get a basic layout. Then I got Drew's presention, exported to
&gt; PDF, then pulled apart the PDF to PPM files. Right now I'm stuck on resizing
&gt; the PPMs to full frame NTSC. :( When I composite them, I end up with garbage.
&gt;
&gt; I was hoping to do it in ImageMagick because it's scriptable and easy. Should
&gt; be able to just pop in the frame on top of the background image and use
&gt; '-gravity center' to get it there. But it's going horribly wrong. Kinda looks
&gt; like a scrambled cable signal. Even worse.
&gt;
&gt; I think I might install Cinellerra and see if it will do it for me.
&gt;
&gt; See my other post for why I'm doing this.
&gt;
&gt; The reason for going to PDF them PPM is because I'm lazy and didn't want to
&gt; save each frame of the presentation individually. I couldn't see how to output
&gt; each frame in batch other than PDF. :/

Here's an example of vnc2swf that I did real quick.  I didn't put any 
audio on it though.

Wow Keith, that kicks butt! Now I know you get get audio into that, but
what about something like this:
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/vncrecording.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/vncrecording.html</a>

So you can export the vnc capture to avi , then maybe use ffmpeg or
something to that extent to interlace the video with the audio? I didn't
see too many FOSS applications that converted swf to avi. :-\

<hr><pre>The advantages of vnc2swf are:

1. the flash files are much smaller, so hosting them on a web server  
is easier and it's not such a huge download for the poor guy with a  
slow connection.
2.  It's cross platform compatable, so for instance if you were  
showing of a really cool FOSS app that is written for window$ you can  
do that too.

Or, as another example, at work, my important servers are all Linux  
based, but my desktop is Windows XP.  vnc2swf runs on Windows, you  
just need to install Python and the two other dependancies.  This has  
been very valuable to me to help make video tutorials for my end  
users, they are a special bunch and it's saved me a lot of time trying  
to explain really simple stuff to them.

Last night, I did just a really basic example, I didn't think to  
resize the video output size, but you can make it so it's not so huge,  
or leave it huge, it's easier to view text that way.

Now, if you were going to make DVDs of the FOSUG presentations, and  
sell them for a few bucks to raise money for the group, then yeah, AVI  
files would be the way to go.

For the most part though, this would probably really help to improve  
the videos from the meetings.  I've downloaded several to see what  
I've been missing (and also because the local group here really  
sucks...) and it's often times very difficult to see what's going on  
on the screens.  The camera doesn't pick pick up the smaller text when  
it's projected.

If you did go with the AVI file though, you could start using your  
video editing skills, by having video of the presentor and then  
cutting to the VNC output to show the screens when they are talking  
about certain examples... that would be pretty cool.

I wasn't looking at it as a fund raising thing, just as a help for those who
are bandwidth challenged.

&gt; it's projected.

For example, from Drew's presentation Saturday, the slides themselves are
relatively easy to read. But you can't see much when he's actually inside of
VMWare doing things. :( But that's only about the last 15 minutes or so, I
think.

&gt; If you did go with the AVI file though, you could start using your  
&gt; video editing skills, by having video of the presentor and then  
&gt; cutting to the VNC output to show the screens when they are talking  
&gt; about certain examples... that would be pretty cool.

That's exactly my idea with what I'm working on.

Meeting Video Update:

If I can get Cinelerra going quickly I'm hoping to have a first cut on Friday
night, or Sat. I've got the slides converted to MPEG, but may see if I can
make AVIs instead to avoid any losses going MPEG to MPEG.

Next up is an intro and a credits section.

I emerged Cinelerra and Blender last night over night and they both started
this morning. Don't know if there were any errors that it was able to keep
going on. For what Blender can do it sure popped open on my system. Cinelerra
came up pretty quickly too.
