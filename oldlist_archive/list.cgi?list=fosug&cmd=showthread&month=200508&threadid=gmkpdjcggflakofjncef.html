Yes.

Looking at their site, I'm starting to think that Fresno has some great,
unsung, engineering-related companies.

Here's a list of three that I know of, now:

- Turner Designs, you mention

- Twining Labs - <a href="http://www.twining.com/">http://www.twining.com/</a> (downtown, close to FPD HQ)

- Pelco - <a href="http://www.pelco.com/">http://www.pelco.com/</a>


n.b Sometime last year, a want-ad of Pelco's served to demonstrate
that they were developing some interest about Linux.

----
Incidental FOSS note: GIS

Twining and Turner, I wonder -- as well as any more persons of the area who
have a sincere interest about GIS -- I wonder if they might find an interest
about GRASS GIS :

  <a href="http://grass.ibiblio.org/">http://grass.ibiblio.org/</a>


[*] Addressing Concern

Y'know, given the wrongs, the traffic, and the popular  paranoia of recent
years, and given the politics occurring across  yay-many years: I've been wary
of mentioning GRASS, online, or mentioning any resources providing data-sets.

The largest of the latter are in the US. The USGS is problaby *the* largest,
e.g.:

  <a href="http://nationalatlas.gov/index.html">http://nationalatlas.gov/index.html</a>
  <a href="http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html">http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html</a>

It should be great to see the USGS *not* try to privatize their services.
Under this present administration, I am concerned, however, if they would.

If they would, it would probably put the USGS datasets out of the budget range
of a number of science organizations, e.g. Fresno's Discovery Center

  <a href="http://discovery.pon.net/">http://discovery.pon.net/</a>

Bush &amp;c. could &quot;play the terror card&quot;, however. It's been a favorite about
federal bureaucratic activity (e.g. BreauHSec &amp;c)

[*] &quot;Back to GRASS&quot;

In what I understand of it, GRASS is one *heck*  of a GIS system.

[**] The Interface.

GRASS has a BASH interface and a TCL/TK interface -- the latter closely
resembling the BASH interface, in how it operates.

It's not such that I can expect most  MSFT-system and Apple-system users to
readily take a cotton to.

GRASS also ships with a LOT of commands; each one has its own purpose, though,
and certainly, each one is documented.

[**] More

[***] GIS Dataset Formats

With its popular GDAL library, GRASS supports an enormous range of dataset
formats, including the popular ShapeFile format.

[***] GRASS and the Database

GRASS supports connection with PostgreSQL, maybe also with MySQL, for storing
and retrieving data-set items. Beside the centralization of information,
afforded with a database, GRASS' support for PostgreSQL and such, it should
serve in ensuring that that data-sets would be interopreated upon, with
additional software.

[***] Security and GRASS-DB Connectivity

N.B When using GRASS with a database, in an agency, there might be some
particular matters addressed, about securing the GRASS-&gt;database connection,
as for:

 1) Authentication

 e.g.

 1A) maybe using kerberos, that being possibly applicable towards a simple,
     single sign-on system

 1B) maybe something about PKI, in  conjunction with FreeS/WAN (mentioned
     below)

 1C) maybe &quot;MUSCLE cards&quot; or whatever other manners of those &quot;smart cards&quot;
     (and analogous pocket-keyring-sized devices, e.g. from veris*, which
     purchased Thawte)  -- like, the cards with the little gold-painted,
     write-once, read-only chips.

     On such a card (or a pocket-keyring device) the chip might be programmed
     (at the agency's programing center; there are small programming devices
     for such cards, I hear, though I am not sure of their brand-names or if
     they have drivers, yet, for Linux) programmed as that the chips would
     contain such information that the system would need to read, in order to
     authenticate the holder of the card. (Someone else may be consulted,
     about how this would be executed, in all. I can only propose that a GPG
     public key woud be stored on the card, with the complimentary private key
     being securely maintained within the authentication system.)

 2) Secure GRASS-&gt;DB Tunnling

 e.g.
  - with SSH tunneling between the GRASS host and the database
  - (if necessary) with SSH tunneling between the user's XServer and the GRASS
    host

 3) Network Security

 e.g.

 3A) applying FreeS/WAN for secure, remote connectivity

 3B) maybe something about PKI, perhaps applied in conjunction with FreeS/WAN,
     and (as possible) applied in conjunction with the key sets that would be
     used for the MUSCLE-style devices

 3C) making a  simple, suitable  firewall configuration (as on the database
     server) regading LAN and gateway activity

[***] Grokking GRASS

To understand GRASS and GIS in general, one might hope to have been introduced
to the mathematics of /geodesics/.

(As I understand such, it's a matter of geometry applied upon spheres --
coincidentally, involving maths for interpoloation of coordinates, between
sphere-based  coordinate systems and  flat-surface coordinate systems)

Some particular matters that might be addressed, regarding maths coincident
about GRASS and GIS, overall:

0) Coordinate Systems

1) Methods for projecting the surface of a sphere onto a flat surface (e.g.
   Mercator) (ultimately, with  some explanation of those projection methods
   that may be used in GRASS, especially those that are used most commonly,
   among common datasets)


2) Vector graphics (dots, lines, and polygons) (also pertains about SVG, and
   Macromedia Flash)


3) Perhaps some discussion about how information is encoded into binary
   formats.


4) An explanation of &quot;metadata&quot; (Like, it's &quot;information about blocks of
   information&quot;) esp. mentioning the fields of metadata used with some common
   GIS dataset formats.


References about such would be helpful, I know (and how I know.  I've been
more concerned about hassles being made for honest GIS dataset users; that's
why I haven't bothered to write more about this, even to contribute anything
to the GRASS project. Furthermore, I recognize that I have no U. background
about geodesics; while that is not an issue in regards to documentation, it
might seem like an issue, in regards to appliction of GRASS, within the
setting of a professional geologically-related agency.)

[*] Conclusion, and Summary of Relevance

Well, I guess that I thought I'd write a first draft (as an outline, with
notes) such that may be servicable for the making of a contributory manual
about GIS, GRASS (and more), also sharing this info.

I know that GIS has been of some local interest  in regards to (rather) more
than &quot;expressly causal&quot; software work (no offense meant, either, about any
casual aproaches to UNIX-style systems)

e.g. relevance:

&gt;From the San Joaquin's Greater Valley Center:
  GIS and Incident Preparedness
  <a href="http://www.greatvalley.org/clic/gis.aspx">http://www.greatvalley.org/clic/gis.aspx</a>

I'd suggest that GIS would be considered in regards to natural resources, also
-- e.g. Resource study, scientifically and pragmatically, as such may be
incorporated with a practice of reasonable resource usage -- as might be
integrated with existing programs for such, whether locally (e.g. of the US
Forest Service, which is certainly far-along about such, already) and perhaps
in the nation of Mexico,  and more nations expressly of South America.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fresno's had more than I've known of, either.

Incidentally, kids from Clovis might ever get to know more of what Fresno has,
of what's worthwhile.

I think that it's *good* to hear more of what Fresno has of anything decent --
e.g. in regards to technology -- even in coincidence about a notification of a
local job-opening, heh.

Adios amigos e amigas
